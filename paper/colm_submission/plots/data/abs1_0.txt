Category: Stellar Physics. A significant fraction of the mass of an old stellar population should be in the form of isolated black holes (BHs). Yet there has never been an unambiguous detection of a solitary BH. The only technique available to detect isolated BHs is astrometric microlensing--relativistic deflection of light from background stars. We have...
