Category: Large Scale Structure of the Universe. Time delays of strongly lensed quasars provide an independent cosmological probe that is primarily sensitive to the Hubble constant, H0. The method relies on precise time-delay measurements from photometric monitoring of the quasar images, which has been accomplished so far for only 7 systems, including 6 quadruply imaged...
