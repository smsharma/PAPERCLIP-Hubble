Category: HOT STARS. Recent studies have used high spatial resolution HST observations of supernova (SN) sites to directly identify the progenitors of core-collapse SNe on pre-explosion images. These studies have set constraints about the nature of massive stars and their evolution just prior to their explosion as SNe. Now, at late-times when the SNe have...
