Category: ISM AND CIRCUMSTELLAR MATTER. We propose to obtain time-resolved spectroscopy of the outburst of the enigmatic historical supernova Cas A using STIS spectroscopy of light scattered by a narrow filament of interstellar dust. Our group has identified recent, high-surface brightness filaments that are likely to provide high signal-to-noise reproduction of the evolving spectrum of...
