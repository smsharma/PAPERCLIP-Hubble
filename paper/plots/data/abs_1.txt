 We propose to obtain time-resolved spectroscopy of the outburst of the enigmatic historical supernova Cas A using STIS spectroscopy of light scattered by a narrow filament of interstellar dust. Our group has identified recent, high-surface brightness filaments that are likely to provide high signal-to-noise reproduction of the evolving spectrum of the Cas A outburst using verified, published techniques developed by us.  The timescales to see any appreciable evolution in individual astrophysical objects are typically many orders of magnitudes larger than a human life.  As a result, astronomers study large numbers of objects at different stages of their evolution to connect how a single object should change with time. Cas A can provide us with the ability, to look back in time to the point of explosion by observing its light echoes -- SN light scattered off of dust in the Milky Way, which causes a time delay in reaching us.  In obtaining spectra of light echoes, we have been able to determine the maximum-light characteristics of the SN. Our goal here is to obtain a single STIS spectrum of a bright Cas A LE, which will provide us a time series of spectra and a spatially resolved light curve of the Cas A SN. With these data, we will measure the properties of the cooling envelope after the shock breakout of the SN to estimate the radius of the progenitor star.  We will then be able to connect the progenitor star to the explosion to the SN to the SNR.
