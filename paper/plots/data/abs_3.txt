 Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) have enormous importance to cosmology and astrophysics, but their progenitors and explosion mechanisms are not known in detail. Recently, observations and theoretical models have suggested that not all thermonuclear white-dwarf supernova explosions are normal SN Ia. In particular, type Iax supernovae (peculiar cousins to SN Ia), are also thought to be exploding white dwarfs. In deep and serendipitous HST pre-explosion data, we have discovered a luminous, blue progenitor system for the type Iax SN 2012Z in NGC 1309. The light in this system, called S1, could be dominated by: a companion star to the exploding white dwarf, accretion onto the exploding white dwarf, a massive star that exploded (suggesting SN Iax are not in fact white-dwarf supernovae), or if we were very unlucky, an unrelated star in a chance alignment. Here we propose HST Cycle 22 ACS/WFC optical imaging to see what, if anything, has happened to S1. These data will allow us to definitively confirm and characterize what may be the first progenitor system discovered for a thermonuclear white dwarf supernova.
