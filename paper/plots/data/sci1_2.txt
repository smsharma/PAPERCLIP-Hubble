characterize ionization structure and distribution of chemically peculiar debris in SN0540--69.3, determine ionization structure in the SN debris of E0102.2--7219, provide benchmarks for models of nucleosynthesis in massive stars, excitation mechanisms in extremely metal-rich plasmas, and supernova explosion dynamics, study the pulsar and synchrotron nebula in SN0540--69.3, investigate SN0540--69.3's proximity to SN 1987A in both space and time, and relation to the same extended complex of young stars
