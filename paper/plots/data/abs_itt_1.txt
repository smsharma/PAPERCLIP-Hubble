short-duration gamma-ray bursts, kilonova, neutron star material, radioactive transients, r-process elements; directly support compact object merger hypothesis for short-duration GRBs, provide new electromagnetic localization signature for gravitational wave sources, suggest kilonovae as likely sites of r-process element production, inform searches of gravitational wave error boxes, quantify contribution to heavy element nucleosynthesis budget
