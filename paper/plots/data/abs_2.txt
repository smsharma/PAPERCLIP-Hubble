 We propose to use the WFPC2 and STIS CCD to obtain maximum spatial resolution emission-line images of the young, oxygen- rich supernova remnants SN0540--69.3 in the LMC and E0102.2-- 7219 in the SMC. O IIILambda5007, S IILambdaLambda6724 and O IILambdaLambda3727 images of SN0540--69.3 will be used to characterize the ionization structure and distribution of chemically peculiar debris which ground-based imaging and spectroscopy have demonstrated to be present but cannot resolve. For E0102.2--7219, we will obtain an O IILambdaLambda3727 image which will be compared to our cycle 5 WFPC2 O IIILambda5007 image in order to determine the ionization structure in the SN debris. These data will provide another in the very limited set of benchmarks against which to measure models for nucleosynthesis in massive stars, excitation mechanisms in extremely metal-rich plasmas and the dynamics of supernova explosions. SN0540--69.3 holds special interest because it contains only the second known example {after the Crab} of an active pulsar and synchrotron nebula in a young supernova remnant. Furthermore, it is located < 400 pc {projected} from SN 1987A and is part of the same extended complex of young stars. Since the SN explosion occurred < 1000 yr ago, SN0540--69.3 is the closest to SN 1987A in both space and time of all known remnants in the LMC.
