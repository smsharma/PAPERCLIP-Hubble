Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  As the closest star forming dwarf galaxy, the SMC is the preferred location for detailed studies of this extremely common class of objects. We therefore propose to use the capabilities of ACS, which provide an improvement by an order of magnitude over what is possible with ground-based optical imaging surveys that are limited by confusion anddepth, to measure key stellar population parameters in the SMC from VI color-magnitude diagrams. Our program focuses on regions where crowding makes HST essential and includes 7 star clusters and 7 field star locations. We will measure accurate ages of the clusters, test stellar evolution models, gain fiducial stellar sequences to use in fitting the field stars, check the form of the IMF, and substantially extend the study of RR Lyrae variables in the key NGC121 SMC globular cluster. The field pointings will allow us to reconstruct the star formation history, look for enhanced star formation that is expected when the SMC interacts with the LMC and/or Milky Way, and compare its main sequence luminosity {and mass} functions with those of the Milky Way, LMC, and UMi dwarf spheroidal. This proposal is part of a coordinated HST and ground-based study of the stellar history and star formation processes in the SMC.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  We propose to make observations that directly test the proposition that globular clusters contain massive black holes. Our targets are the bulge globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. These are probably among the most massive  in the galaxy, but are understudied compared to more familiar objects such as M15. Our analysis suggests that these two clusters are the most likely to show unambiguous evidence for a central massive black hole if such things exist in globular clusters. The observations proposed will give us the first thorough kinematic and photometric studies of these two clusters. The combination of the two epochs will give us proper motions good to of order 6 km/s. In addition, they will provide us with the first good, deep, color-magnitude diagrams for these clusters. These diagrams will be used to investigate the make up of the stellar population in the clusters, to more firmly establish their distances, ages, and metallicities, and to search for a binary sequence.

Category: .  We propose to calibrate the geometric distortion of the WFC and HRC of ACS, using the state-of-the-art techniques that we have developed for WFPC2. We are confident that we can measure the distortion to at least an order or magnitude higher accuracy than is called for in the ACS Manual. We will use the images that are to be taken in GO-9028 and will re- image the field used there at different orientation and through different filters, so as to improve knowledge of the skewness of the field and the dependence of distortion on wavelength. Our results will not only enhance the accuracy of our own proposed proper-motion work in star clusters; they will greatly increase the accuracy of sparse-field astrometry by others, such as solar-sytem and extragalactic work.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS IN CLUSTERS.  Knowledge of star formation in old populations is a vital ingredient in understanding galactic evolution. Globular star clusters offer the possibility of observing the mass functions of homogeneous old stellar populations. Those for which reliable mass functions have been determined already, however, have generally been subject to dynamical evolution {relaxation, escape of stars, and tidal shocks}, so that the observed mass function is not primordial. We have therefore examined tables of properties of globular clusters in order to choose those that are least likely to have suffered from relaxation, escape, and tidal shocks. We propose two new targets {NGC 2808 and M53}, and dynamical rediscussion of existing data on one other {M3}. To minimize mass-segregation corrections, in each cluster we will select a field at the radius where the local mass function most closely resembles the global mass function. The range of metallicities of the targets will also allow us to estimate the influence of metallicity on the IMF. The team has leading-edge expertise in all the techniques required: making the observations and reducing them to luminosity functions, converting to mass functions, and all types of dynamical modeling, which are required to make the small corrections to global and then initial mass functions.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Stellar Populations Part III: Globular Cluster Cores.	The cores of 2 globular clusters will be imaged in U to study core properties and search for collapsed cusps.  The clusters are relatively nearby and span the range from very regular to very cusplike.
Category: BINARY STARS.  The ultimate test for the total number and characteristics of cataclysmic variables {CVs} and compact binaries in the core of a globular cluster can best be conducted on the closest collapsed core cluster, NGC 6397. We propose to use our proven successful method of deep H Alpha {F656N} and R {F675W} imaging with WFPC2 to identify essentially all CV candidates down to M_V ~ 12. This extends our WFPC1 discovery of emission line candidates in NGC6397, confirmed as CVs with FOS spectra, to virtually the entire CV luminosity function including the faintest magnetic systems which our FOS results suggest may be dominant in globulars. With interwoven V and I frames, we shall also constrain the CV disk vs. secondary star colors and thus masses of the secondary star and WD {lower limit}, allow for short-term variability searches, and constrain the {primordial} main sequence binary population for direct comparison with other clusters {e.g. NGC 6752}. Comparison with our deep ROSAT HRI image will identify still fainter dim x-ray sources as well as provide the optical identification data for our planned GTO observations of NGC 6397 with AXAF.

Category: Stellar Populations.  Dwarf galaxies are excellent test particles for studying dynamical properties of the Local Group (LG) and the role of environment in quenching of star formation in low-mass galaxies. In this context, galaxies at the edge of the LG are of particular interest. They enable an estimate of the mass of the LG throught the radius of the turn-around surface. However, how dwarfs can be located at such large distances from the barycenter of the LG is still an open question. It may be that these galaxies are on their first infall into the LG potential well. Alternatively, they may have been close to their first orbital apocenter when the LG decoupled from the Hubble flow, the so-called splashback radius. Depending on this issue, the enviroment the dwarfs have moved through can be quite different. This environment also affects their star formation history through e.g. quenching. Here we propose to measure proper motions (PM) 4 dwarfs located at the edge of the LG: 2 dwarf irregulars (LeoA and Sag dIrr) and 2 dwarf spheroidals (Cetus and Tucana). These are the only dwarfs at the edge of the Local Group with first epoch archival data for PM measurements and star formation history determination. We will construct full three-dimensional velocity vectors, trace back their orbits, calculate the LG Mass, and determine whether past interactions with the MW or M31 can explain their different morphologies and star-formation histories.

Category: STELLAR POPS.  High-precision astrometry throughout the Milky Way halo is a unique capability of HST, with potential for transformative science, including constraining the nature of dark matter, probing the epoch of reionization, and understanding key physics of galaxy formation. While Gaia will provide unparalleled astrometric precision for bright stars in the inner halo of the Milky Way, HST is the only current mission capable of measuring (1) accurate orbital proper motions for systems at greater distances (> 80 kpc), in order to measure the total mass profile of the Milky Way, or (2) internal kinematics of stars in dwarf galaxies, to test the cusp versus core nature of their inner density profiles. We propose to initiate the next-generation, high-precision, proper-motion survey of all known dwarf galaxies within the Milky Way halo, thus laying the foundation to dynamically map the nearby Universe in full 6-D orbital phase space. Specifically, we propose to use ACS/WFC3 to establish a first-epoch baseline for proper-motion measurements for the 32 known dwarf galaxies within 420 kpc that currently lack sufficient first-epoch imaging. These observations will provide the critical anchor point for forefront scientific results within the next 4 years of HST's life, which can be extended with future missions, including JWST, over 10+ years to obtain unprecedented astrometric accuracy, ensuring that HST leaves a unique and lasting legacy for decades to come.

Category: QUASAR ABSORPTION LINES AND IGM.  We propose HST-COS spectroscopy of 10 quasars behind M31. Absorption lines due to MgII, FeII, CIV, and a variety of other lines will be searched for and measured. Six quasars lie between 1 and 4.2 Holmberg radii near the major axis on the southwest side, where confusion with Milky Way gas is minimized. Two lie even farther out on the southwest side of the major axis. One lies within 1 Holmberg radius. Two of the 10 pass through M31's high velocity clouds seen in a detailed 21 cm emission map. Exposure time estimates were based on SDSS magnitudes and available GALEX magnitudes. Thus, using the most well-studied external spiral galaxy in the sky, our observations will permit us to check, better than ever before, the standard picture that quasar metal-line absorption systems such as MgII and CIV arise in an extended gaseous halo/disk of a galaxy well beyond its observable optical radius. The observations will yield insights into the nature of the gas and its connection to the very extended stellar components of M31 that have recently been studied. Notably the observations have the potential of extending M31's rotation curve to very large galactocentric distances, thereby placing new constrants on M31's dark matter halo.  Finally, we also request that the coordinated parallel orbits be allocated to this program so that we may image the resolved stellar content of M31's halo and outer disk.
Category: Galaxies and the IGM.  Spiral galaxies dominate the stellar mass density in the Universe, yet the details of their formation and evolution are still greatly debated. The simulations based on the current cosmological model show that these galaxies grow in mass through accretion and mergers. One of the consequence of this galaxy assembly process is the formation of an old, metal-poor stellar halo. However, to date the presence of a spheroidal component in low-mass spirals is elusive and controversial, mostly due to the difficulty to detect such a faint, diffuse component amid the foreground/background contamination. We propose a novel method to detect and characterize such a halo in the nearby, edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 55, that by-passes these limitations by using the pulsational properties of its RR Lyrae stars. These observations will allow us to i) firmly establish the presence of an old stellar halo, ii) quantify its early chemical evolution, and iii) determine the nature of its building blocks. We will use the resulting deep color-magnitude diagrams reaching 1.5 magnitudes below the horizontal-branch to test halo and thick disk formation models.

Category: ISM AND CIRCUMSTELLAR MATTER.  SAINTS is a program to observe SN 1987A, the brightest supernova since 1604, as it matures into the youngest supernova remnant at age 21. HST is the essential tool for resolving SN1987A's many physical components.  A violent encounter is underway between the fastest-moving debris and the circumstellar ring: shocks excite "hotspots." Radio, optical, infrared and X-ray fluxes have been rising rapidly: we have organized Australia Telescope, HST, VLT, Spitzer, and Chandra observations to understand the several emission mechanisms at work. Photons from the shocked ring will excite previously invisible gas outside the ring, revealing the true extent of the mass loss that preceded the explosion of Sanduleak -69 202.  This will help test ideas for the progenitor of SN 1987A. The inner debris, excited by radioactive isotopes from the explosion, is now resolved and seen to be aspherical, providing direct evidence on the shape of the explosion itself.  Questions about SN 1987A remain unanswered.  A rich and unbroken data set from SAINTS will help answer these central questions and will build an archive for the future to help answer questions we have not yet thought to ask.
Category: STELLAR PHYSICS.  This programme will provide a 30 year legacy point for SN 1987A, the brightest supernova since 1604. HST is the essential tool for resolving and analysing SN 1987A's several physical components. The inner, asymmetric ejecta are being heated by X-rays from the circumstellar ring and allow us to directly observe the geometry of the explosion. At the same time the fastest-moving ejecta are interacting with the ring, giving rise to bright emission from shocks. Our latest observations show that the ring is fading and that new spots are appearing outside, signalling that the blast wave has passed the ring and is now interacting with previously unseen material. It is also the beginning of the end for the ring. Here we propose to use COS and STIS to obtain a complete UV/optical spectrum of the ejecta and ring. The spectrum will enable a detailed modelling of the nucleosynthesis, which is a powerful diagnostic of the explosion, and provide a unique opportunity to study a supernova spectrum in the transition phase between a radioactively powered supernova and a shock heated remnant. It will also allow us to distinguish between different excitation mechanisms for the molecular hydrogen, recently discovered in the NIR. We also propose a set of broad and narrow band images to monitor the evolution of the flux and morphology of ejecta, ring and new spots outside the ring. The latter will tell us about the mass-loss history of the progenitor. The proposed observations will provide a crucial complement to recent Herschel and ALMA observations of dust, CO and SiO in the ejecta.

Category: ISM AND CIRCUMSTELLAR MATTER.  SN 1987A is the great supernova of the HST era.  It is the only case where we have detailed knowledge of the pre-existing structure in the circumstellar gas.  It is the only case where we can observe the details of a transition from supernova to supernova remnant. An unbroken string of observations is the essential tool for detecting change and establishing a uniform legacy archive.  As we have demonstrated, images reveal a wide variety of processes at work-- most notably the change in the energetics of the debris from radioactive power in the first 5000 days to X-ray illumination from the outside at the present day.  We also observed the explosive eruption of "hotspots" around the circumstellar ring and are now using their time history to infer their structure.  We have devised a way to image the reverse shock at both Lyman alpha and H-alpha that will help solve a riddle in the excitation of these lines and illuminate the hydrodynamics of the site where non-thermal processes are at work.  We propose this novel UV work for the current cycle.  The HST observations have a unique blend of photometric fidelity and angular resolution that also makes them the indispensable partner to ongoing X-ray, radio, and far-IR observations.	ALMA provides a new way to study dust formation and the kinematics of the explosion by comparison to HST images.	This HST program is a long term study: for a 25 year old remnant, we believe brief and simple annual sampling is adequate, but an ongoing commitment is essential.

HST is the unique and perfect tool for spatially-resolved observations of the many physical components of SN 1987A. A violent encounter is underway between the fastest-moving debris and the circumstellar ring, exciting hotspots seen with HST that are suddenly lighting up. The optical and X-ray flux from the ring are both rising rapidly: HST and Chandra observations taken together are needed to understand the physics of these shocked regions. In Cycle14, the hotspots may fuse as the shock fully enters the ring. Photons from these shocks may excite previously hidden gas outside the ring, revealing the true extent of the mass loss that preceded the explosion. The inner debris of the explosion itself, still excited by radioactive isotopes produced in the explosion, is now well resolved by ACS and seen to be aspherical, providing direct clues to the mechanism of the explosion. Our search for a compact remnant is beginning to eliminate some theoretical possibilities and we have the opportunity in Cycle 14 to place much more stringent limits with NICMOS. Many questions about SN 1987A remain unanswered. How did the enigmatic three rings form in the late stages of Sanduleak -69 202? Precisely what took place in the center during the core collapse and bounce? Is a black hole or a neutron star left behind in the debris?

Category: INTERSTELLAR AND INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM.  SAINTS is a program to observe SN 1987A, the brightest supernova in 384 years, as it morphs into the youngest supernova remnant at age 18. HST is the unique and perfect tool for spatially-resolved observations of the many physical components of SN 1987A.

Category: COSMOLOGY.  We propose the continuation of our highly successful ACS+WFC3 SNAPshot survey of a sample of 125 very X-ray luminous clusters in the redshift range 0.3-0.7, detected and compiled by the MACS cluster survey. As demonstrated by ACS/WFC3 SNAPshots of 63 MACS clusters obtained by us in previous Cycles {14 of them in all of F606W, F814W, F110W, and F140W}, dedicated HST observations of the 12 most distant MACS clusters {GO-09722}, and the CLASH MCT programme, these systems are highly efficient gravitational lenses as well as ideal targets for studies of galaxy evolution in dense environments.  Our primary science goals are a} the discovery of additional bright, giant arcs for resolved, in-depth, spectroscopic study with 8-10m telescopes, b} the selection of Distant Red Galaxies as well as z>6 galaxies as F814W dropouts, and c} the identification of extremely luminous but optically faint submm galaxies at z=2-5 detected in our Herschel/SPIRE observations of this sample. In addition, the proposed observations will d} provide important constraints on the mass distributions in these extreme systems, and e} improve our understanding of the physical nature of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-gas interactions in cluster cores.  In recognition of the particular value of WFC3 images for our primary science goals {so far, only 21 WFC3/SNAPs have been executed}, we stagger the proposed visits such that SNAPshots in the WFC3/F110W and F140W passbands will be executed first, followed by ACS observations in the F606W and F814W filters. The images thus obtained will build a dataset of legacy value for a wide range of extragalactic research topics.
Category: .  As the most massive objects in the universe, galaxy clusters represent important signposts in our story of structure evolution, and are the ultimate telescopic lenses, placing gravitationally lensed galaxies from the earliest epochs in comfortable reach for careful study. We take full advantage of the refurbished ACS and WFC3 cameras to deliver deep 14-filter images of 25 carefully chosen clusters. These will enable us to address timely and substantive questions about dark matter, dark energy, and galaxy evolution well beyond z=7. These X-ray clusters are chosen to be free of lensing bias and to span a wide range of redshift and mass. By combining strong and weak lensing, we will obtain the definitive mass profile of relaxed clusters to confront the distinctive prediction of the standard LambdaCDM model. Detailed maps of internal structure will be enabled by ~1,000 new multiply-imaged lensed sources to AB=26, all with precise {2% x {1+z}} photometric redshift measurements, thanks to WFC3's UV and IR coverage.  A supernovae search in parallel {with low magnification uncertainties} will extend the Hubble diagram of SN1a to z>1.5, testing the constancy of dark energy with time and probing progenitor evolution. Our homogeneous panchromatic deep imaging of this cluster sample will constitute a vast legacy archive for studies of the formation and evolution of structure.

Category: COSMOLOGY.  In spite of recent progress, the role of distant galaxies in cosmic reionization has been difficult to pin down. A powerful way to make progress is to move beyond counting high redshift sources and study the stellar properties of the population instead. Accurate knowledge of the average star formation density and its recent history in the universe at this epoch is necessary to determine whether these galaxies emit enough hard photons to reionize the Universe. SURFS UP is a Spitzer Exploration Science program (PI Bradac) designed to measure stellar masses and ages of galaxies at z >~ 7 and identify the dominant sources of the bulk of ionizing photons necessary to drive reionization. The last observations were completed in March 2014. The program uses 10 galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes to study galaxies at intrinsically lower luminosities than blank field surveys of the same exposure time. All clusters but one have both extremely deep HST and Spitzer data available. The last cluster (MACS2214) is lacking HST WFC3-IR data which are crucial to select galaxies at z >~ 7, to study their instantaneous star formation rate via rest-frame UV, and to study their evolved population via rest-frame optical. We request here 5 orbits of WFC3-IR data, which will be a crucial complement to the existing extremely deep Spitzer and HST-ACS data for MACS2214, as well as to the entire SURFS UP sample. The proposal will double the number of currently detected sub-L* galaxies at z>~7 that have been detected by Spitzer and for which we can measure stellar masses and ages. The request of 5 orbits will strongly increase the legacy value of SURFS UP and we waive any proprietary rights.
Category: COSMOLOGY.  The brightest, strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies are veritable gems to study intense star formation in the early Universe. How do the high and irregular "clumpy" stellar and gas mass surface densities, strong radiation fields, and high turbulence regulate the rapid growth of these galaxies?  We will use HST/WFC3 to investigate the stellar component of 6 of the brightest high-redshift sub-millimeter galaxies on the sky, which were recently discovered with the Planck all-sky survey. All are giant arcs or partial Einstein rings with angular sizes up to 17" in shallow CFHT K-band or Spitzer/IRAC imaging. FIR luminosities are 10^13-14 L_sun, with dust SEDs strongly dominated by intense star formation near the maximum possible rates ("maximal starbursts"). All have spectroscopic redshifts z=2.2-3.6 and magnification factors >/=20. We already have multiwavelength data sets to characterize their gas and dust column densities and kinematics, and propose here to acquire deep, high-resolution rest-frame optical imaging to study the stellar populations and morphologies. With WFC3 imaging in F110W & F160W we will:  (1) constrain the stellar morphologies, ages, and mass-to-light ratios  (2) Identify clumps and measure their properties to test several clump formation scenarios  (3) Enhance our on-going lens modeling through the most accurate positions, morphologies and colors  Only the brightest of the arc clumps are visible from the ground in the NIR. To register the flux along the full extent of the arcs, and importantly to probe individual star forming regions of the size of 30 Dor at z~2-3 in the brightest high-z sub-mm galaxies requires HST.

Category: COSMOLOGY.  HST is now uniquely capable of measuring the time variation of dark energy (DE) using supernovae (SNe) - and to address the recent surprising low DE density measured at very high redshift by BAO. The MCT survey has shown that field SN rates at z>1 are too low to accomplish this, but it can be done with a search for SNe in massive clusters.  Based on the high SN rate found in our ACS-NICMOS SN cluster survey, we propose a cadenced two-cycle SN survey of 10 of the most massive known clusters at z = 1.1 to 1.75. We expect to accurately measure ~30 Type Ia SNe at these redshifts. The exquisite sensitivity of WFC3 ensures that each SN will have the high S/N color measurements necessary to provide the necessary control of the dominant astrophysical systematics so we can measure the density history of DE over the largest possible z range.  With this calibration, our SN results at z>1 will be limited by statistical rather than systematic errors.  This unique cluster data set will also be used for numerous key cosmology questions:  Weak lensing (WL) cluster-masses derived from our imaging will allow the first calibration of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)-mass relation at z > 1 at the level of precision required to make SZ derived masses competitive as strong measurements of DE.  For the main science goal of this proposal, we can shrink the uncertainty on DE density at z>1 below +/- 0.6 - and be able distinguish the recent BAO low-density result from a cosmological constant at almost 3 sigma. We improve the uncertainty on DE equation of state w at redshifts z > 0.5 by a factor of three using SNe alone, and by combining the SN and WL results, double the DETF Figure of Merit to over 100.

Category: COSMOLOGY.  We have isolated a sample of 9 luminous {~2L*} galaxies with the very oldest stellar populations at their respective redshifts. The galaxies have been found in radio-source fields chosen to be at the key redshifts z~1.5 and z~2.5, which allow the cleanest separation of old stellar populations from highly reddened starbursts with colors derived from standard filter combinations. Ground-based observations in excellent seeing and with adaptive optics of 3 of these galaxies indicate that all 3 are dominated by well relaxed disks of old stars, suggesting that the first large stellar systems to form in the universe were disks in which star formation proceeded extremely rapidly and efficiently. In order to test this conjecture, we are requesting NICMOS2 exposures of our sample to obtain high S/N imaging in the F160W filter to determine detailed morphologies of the old stellar population, coupled with either NICMOS2 F110W or ACS F814W exposures {depending on redshift} to determine color gradients and/or other systematic color variations that might provide clues to formation processes.

Category: GALAXIES.  We propose to image the cD galaxy host of the most powerful radio outburst known in the Universe. The outburst was identified in a Chandra image of a z=0.216 galaxy cluster which revealed a pair of enormous cavities, each 200 kpc in diameter, embedded in its X-ray halo. The outburst began approximately 100 Myr ago and has expended 6x10^61 ergs. It is apparently powered by accretion onto the cD's billion solar mass nuclear black hole, which grew heavier by roughly 1/3 during the outburst. We intend to examine the morphology and nuclear environment of the host galaxy to understand the conditions that created this remarkable event.

Category: COSMOLOGY.  The aim of these observations is to obtain deep z/ACS and H/NICMOS images in the core of two lensing clusters, A1835 and AC114, where a few z ~ 7-10 galaxy candidates have been selected from our ultra-deep JHK imaging program with Isaac/VLT. Spectroscopic observations have allowed to confirm 2 of these candidates thanks to the detection of faint emission lines identified as Lyman alpha at z=7.2 and 10. Our HST project is focused on two main goals: {1} the morphological confirmation of galaxy candidates lying near critical lines, and {2} the determination of the physical scales involved in star-forming regions at z ~ 7-10. These goals should have important implications on our present knowledge of the galaxy formation process in the early Universe.

Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  We propose to observe one of the most metal-rich globular cluster ever found, G177, recently identified in M31. We wish to take deep images in V and I bands, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution and red sensitivity of the Planetary Camera of WFPC2/HST, in order to build their colour-magnitude diagrams.  With respect to the outstanding properties of G177, we will address the questions of its metallicity, both in absolute scale, by confrontation with theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks, and in  relative scale, by comparison with coeval observations of two other clusters, G1 and G170, used as standards.  The data we propose to obtain would provide essential input for theories of stellar evolution, star formation history, and models of star cluster and galaxy formation.
Category: GALAXIES.  We propose to constrain the origin of spiral galaxy halos by studying stellar populations near the tip of the red giant branch. This will be the first systematic study of this population in external galaxies and will quadruple the sample of normal spiral galaxies for which the halo metallicity distribution function is measured. This larger sample will permit us to study the relationship between the bulge, disk, and halo components and between halos and globular systems. Such correlations will in turn provide indications as to whether the halo, bulge, and globular cluster systems built up nearly simultaneously in the early universe or were accreted over time through different kinds of merging events.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Our recent deep HST photometry of the M31 halo globular cluster {GC} Mayall~II, also called G1, has revealed a red-giant branch with a clear spread that we attribute to an intrinsic metallicity dispersion of at least 0.4 dex in [Fe/H]. The only other GC exhibiting such a metallicity dispersion is Omega Centauri, the brightest and most massive Galactic GC, whose range in [Fe/H] is about 0.5 dex. These observations are obviously linked to the fact that both G1 and Omega Cen are bright and massive GC, with potential wells deep enough to keep part of their gas, which might have been recycled, producing a metallicity scatter among cluster stars. These observations dramatically challenge the notion of chemical homogeneity as a defining characteristic of GCs. It is critically important to find out how common this phenomenon is and how it can constrain scenarios/models of GC formation. The obvious targets are other bright and massive GCs, which exist in M31 but not in our Galaxy where Omega Cen is an isolated giant. We propose to acquire, with ACS/HRC, deep imaging of 3 of the brightest M31 GCs for which we have observed velocity dispersion values similar to those observed in G1 and Omega Cen. A sample of GCs with chemical abundance dispersions will provide essential information about their formation mechanism. This would represent a major step for the studies of the origin and evolution of stellar populations.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  We propose to observe one of the most metal-rich globular cluster ever found, G177, recently identified in M31. We wish to take deep images in V and I bands, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution and red sensitivity of the Planetary Camera of WFPC2/HST, in order to build their colour-magnitude diagrams.  With respect to the outstanding properties of G177, we will address the questions of its metallicity, both in absolute scale, by confrontation with theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks, and in  relative scale, by comparison with coeval observations of two other clusters, G1 and G170, used as standards.  The data we propose to obtain would provide essential input for theories of stellar evolution, star formation history, and models of star cluster and galaxy formation.
Category: UNRESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS AND GALAXY STRUCTUR.  The Spitzer Legacy project SINGS provided a unique view of the current state of star formation and dust in a sample of galaxies of all Hubble types. This multi-wavelength view allowed the team to create current star formation diagnostics that are independent of the dust content and increased our understanding of the dust in galaxies. Even so, using the SINGS data alone we can only make rough estimates of the recent star formation history of these galaxies. The lack of U-band observations means that it is impossible to estimate the ages of young clusters. In addition, the low resolution of the Spitzer and ground-based observations means that what appear to be individual Spitzer sources can actually be composed of many individual clusters with varying ages. In this proposal we plan to address this missing area in SINGS by obtaining high-resolution WFPC2 UBVI observations to accurately find and determine the ages of the young stellar clusters in a subset of the SINGS galaxies. These observations will greatly enhance the legacy value of the SINGS observations while also directly answering questions pertaining to star formation in galaxies.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Our recent deep HST photometry of the M31 halo globular cluster {GC} Mayall~II, also called G1, has revealed a red-giant branch with a clear spread that we attribute to an intrinsic metallicity dispersion of at least 0.4 dex in [Fe/H]. The only other GC exhibiting such a metallicity dispersion is Omega Centauri, the brightest and most massive Galactic GC, whose range in [Fe/H] is about 0.5 dex. These observations are obviously linked to the fact that both G1 and Omega Cen are bright and massive GC, with potential wells deep enough to keep part of their gas, which might have been recycled, producing a metallicity scatter among cluster stars. These observations dramatically challenge the notion of chemical homogeneity as a defining characteristic of GCs. It is critically important to find out how common this phenomenon is and how it can constrain scenarios/models of GC formation.

Category: Galaxies & Clusters.  The parallel program described here provides a random sample of galaxies in a large number of high latitude fields. Galactic star counts and the structure of the galactic halo will also be studied. The proposed exposures utilize the WFPC2 in parallel mode when another instrument is prime at high galactic latitude. The expectation is that these fields will represent a fair sample of the universe and the Galactic halo. This is a continuation of proposal 4849 into cycle 4. It is more or less identical except cycle 4 => cycle 5.

Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Most planetary nebulae (PNe) are field objects. Precious little is known about their progenitor stars' properties and how they relate to those of the PN. The lone exceptions are the very rare cases where a PN is a member of an open star cluster. Then one can determine the ages, masses, and compositions of the progenitors, providing direct tests of stellar-evolution theory.  We have recently discovered three PNe belonging to open clusters in M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. Here we propose a set of HST follow-up investigations.  For the PN in the M31 cluster B477-D075, we know its precise location, and there are excellent photometric data (from the M31 PHAT project) that establish the host cluster's age (350 Myr) and the mass of the PN progenitor star (3.35 Msun). We will use STIS spectroscopy in the UV and optical to measure He, CNO, and alpha-process abundances in the nebula, based on emission-line fluxes and a photoionization code. Our primary aim is to compare the measured abundances with predictions of post-AGB evolution theory. In particular, "hot-bottom burning" is expected to produce enhanced He/H and N/O abundances when the progenitor star is sufficiently massive, but it is uncertain whether this occurs at masses as low as ~3 Msun, or requires masses of at least ~5 Msun. Thus our observations will provide key new constraints on AGB evolution of intermediate-mass stars.  For two other M31 clusters, B458-D049 and SK044A, whose integrated-light spectra show that a PN is present, we will use WFC3 with an [O III] filter to verify the presence of the PNe, and determine their precise astrometric locations. We will then follow up with STIS spectroscopy in a future HST Cycle.
Category: QUASAR ABSORPTION LINES AND IGM.  We propose HST-COS spectroscopy of 10 quasars behind M31. Absorption lines due to MgII, FeII, CIV, and a variety of other lines will be searched for and measured. Six quasars lie between 1 and 4.2 Holmberg radii near the major axis on the southwest side, where confusion with Milky Way gas is minimized. Two lie even farther out on the southwest side of the major axis. One lies within 1 Holmberg radius. Two of the 10 pass through M31's high velocity clouds seen in a detailed 21 cm emission map. Exposure time estimates were based on SDSS magnitudes and available GALEX magnitudes. Thus, using the most well-studied external spiral galaxy in the sky, our observations will permit us to check, better than ever before, the standard picture that quasar metal-line absorption systems such as MgII and CIV arise in an extended gaseous halo/disk of a galaxy well beyond its observable optical radius. The observations will yield insights into the nature of the gas and its connection to the very extended stellar components of M31 that have recently been studied. Notably the observations have the potential of extending M31's rotation curve to very large galactocentric distances, thereby placing new constrants on M31's dark matter halo.  Finally, we also request that the coordinated parallel orbits be allocated to this program so that we may image the resolved stellar content of M31's halo and outer disk.
Category: STELLAR POPS.  High-precision astrometry throughout the Milky Way halo is a unique capability of HST, with potential for transformative science, including constraining the nature of dark matter, probing the epoch of reionization, and understanding key physics of galaxy formation. While Gaia will provide unparalleled astrometric precision for bright stars in the inner halo of the Milky Way, HST is the only current mission capable of measuring (1) accurate orbital proper motions for systems at greater distances (> 80 kpc), in order to measure the total mass profile of the Milky Way, or (2) internal kinematics of stars in dwarf galaxies, to test the cusp versus core nature of their inner density profiles. We propose to initiate the next-generation, high-precision, proper-motion survey of all known dwarf galaxies within the Milky Way halo, thus laying the foundation to dynamically map the nearby Universe in full 6-D orbital phase space. Specifically, we propose to use ACS/WFC3 to establish a first-epoch baseline for proper-motion measurements for the 32 known dwarf galaxies within 420 kpc that currently lack sufficient first-epoch imaging. These observations will provide the critical anchor point for forefront scientific results within the next 4 years of HST's life, which can be extended with future missions, including JWST, over 10+ years to obtain unprecedented astrometric accuracy, ensuring that HST leaves a unique and lasting legacy for decades to come.

Category: RESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Models of galaxy formation in a cosmological context predict that massive disk galaxies should have richly-structured extended stellar halos, containing ~10% of a galaxy's stars, originating in large part from the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies. Observations of a number of nearby disk galaxies have generally agreed with these expectations.  Recent new observations in integrated light with a novel array of low scattered-light telephoto lenses have failed to convincingly detect a stellar halo in the nearby massive face-on disk galaxy M101 (van Dokkum et al. 2014). They argue that any halo has to have <0.3% of the mass of the galaxy. This halo would be the least massive of any massive disk galaxy in the local Universe (by factors of several) -- such a halo is not predicted or naturally interpreted by the models, and would present a critical challenge to the picture of ubiquitous stellar halos formed from the debris of disrupting dwarf galaxies.  We propose to resolve the stellar populations of this uniquely anemic stellar halo for 6 orbits with HST (ACS and WFC3), allowing us to reach surface brightness limits sufficient to clearly detect and characterize M101's stellar halo if it carries more than 0.1% of M101's mass. With resolved stellar populations, we can use the gradient of stellar populations as a function of radius to separate stellar halo from disk, which is impossible using integrated light observations. The resolved stellar populations will reveal the halo mass to much greater accuracy, measure the halo radial profile, constrain any halo lopsidedness, estimate the halo's stellar metallicity, and permit an analysis of outer disk stellar populations.

Category: RESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Stellar streams in the Milky Way {MW} support the view that much of its halo was formed hierarchically via the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. These streams are unique dynamical tracers of the dark matter halo, and provide strong tests of galaxy formation models. The Orphan Stream, discovered in the SDSS survey area, is closer, colder, and fainter than the better known Sagittarius {Sgr} Stream, and it has no known parent galaxy. It therefore allows a study of the less-massive objects that built up the MW halo. Lack of proper motion {PM} data limits our understanding of stream orbits and MW dark halo properties. HST's excellent astrometric accuracy can now address this, as demonstrated by our ongoing Sgr Stream study. We propose here to map the PM variation along the Orphan Stream. We will target four fields with ACS/WFC for which serendipitous first-epoch observations exist in the Archive with 10-12 yr time baselines. PM accuracies near 6 km/s will be achieved by measuring the relative motion between stream stars and background galaxies, using techniques developed by us for other successful PM programs {e.g., LMC/SMC, Leo I, M31}. We will interpret the results using dynamical calculations and N-body models, using our techniques already developed for modeling the Sgr and Magellanic Streams. Our study will yield the orbit of the Orphan Stream, which in turn may allow us to identify its progenitor {if not already entirely disrupted}. The orbit will also strongly constrain the shape and mass of the MW dark halo, especially when combined with our ongoing studies of other streams.
Category: UNRESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS AND GALAXY STRUCTUR.  The structure and evolution of giant elliptical galaxies provide key quantitative tests for the theory of hierarchical galaxy formation in a cold dark matter dominated universe.  Strong gravitational lensing provides the only direct means for the measurement of individual elliptical galaxy masses beyond the local universe, but there are currently no large and homogeneous samples of strong lens galaxies at significant cosmological look-back time. Hence, an accurate and unambiguous measurement of the evolution of the mass-density structure of elliptical galaxies has until now been impossible. Using spectroscopic data from the recently initiated Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey {BOSS} of luminous elliptical galaxies at redshifts from approximately 0.4 to 0.7, we have identified a large sample of high-probability strong gravitational lens candidates at significant cosmological look-back time, based on the detection of emission-line features from more distant galaxies along the same lines of sight as the target ellipticals.  We propose to observe 45 of these systems with the ACS-WFC in order to confirm the incidence of lensing and to measure the masses of the lens galaxies.	We will complement these lensing mass measurements with stellar velocity dispersions from ground-based follow-up spectroscopy.	In combination with similar data from the Sloan Lens ACS {SLACS} Survey at lower redshifts, we will directly measure the cosmic evolution of the ratio between lensing mass and dynamical mass, to reveal the structural explanation for the observed size evolution of elliptical galaxies {at high mass}.	We will also measure the evolution of the logarithmic mass-density profile of massive ellipticals, which is sensitive to the details of the merging histories through which they are assembled.  Finally, we will use our lensing mass-to-light measurements to translate the BOSS galaxy luminosity function into a mass function, and determine its evolution in combination with data from the original Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  We propose to exploit the resolution of the WFPC2 to obtain U, V, R, and I and narrow band H Alpha and O III images of an optimally-selected sample of three local dwarf starburst galaxies in order to understand the mechanism of star formation in these systems. These objects have O III equivalent widths greater than 50Angstrom. These dwarf galaxies are close enough that massive stars can be resolved by HST and are extremely important local laboratories for the study of star formation. This type of low luminosity irregular galaxy has been shown to evolve significantly from redshifts of 0.5 - 1 to the current epoch {Glazebrook et al. 1995, Driver et al. 1995, Lilly et al. 1995} in contrast to the more luminous population of early type systems that do not seem to evolve. The understanding of the evolutionary processes in these systems is unclear but interactions, merging, and general starburst activity seem to play a major role. Our detailed study of the sample proposed here may be of significant help in understanding the physics of these objects and there evolution. Many fundamental questions about the essential physical nature of these and larger starburst systems remain unanswered including: {1} is the mass function of a burst restricted to the high mass end; {2} does it depend on metallicity; {3} what physical mechanisms actually trigger the burst. Our HST data will have sufficient spatial resolution to resolve isolated individual high mass main sequence stars and super giants and to distinguish clusters similar to R136A.
Category: GALAXIES.  We propose WFPC2 imaging of two interacting galaxy pairs in two bandpasses {B and I}. In the two-dimensional space of interactions that go from weak to strong, and from early to late, these 2 pairs represent the as-yet unstudied cases of ``late weak'' and ``early strong'' interactions. Our goal is primarily to determine whether the super star clusters {SSC's} that are so prevalent in strong, evolved interactions have also been able to form in the weak or young interactions. Secondly, if such clusters are found, we hope to correlate their properties as much as possible to the strengths and ages of the interactions, using the results of previous HST studies {by other authors} of SSC's in older, stronger interactions to complete the correlation space study. We wish to derive the luminosity function, color distribution, and spatial distribution of these clusters, with the hope of correlating those properties with {a} the distribution and site-specific properties of H II regions that are already seen in ground- based H-alpha observations and with {b} the global physical parameters of the tidal interaction event. In this way, we hope to understand further what are the conditions under which such massive star clusters form, what is their prevalence at the present epoch in violently star-forming regions, and are these regions likely analogs for early epochs of star and galaxy formation.
Category: GALAXIES.  Rings of star formation are a common phenomenon of early-type spiral galaxies. Most rings form by gas cloud collisions near resonances, under the continuous action of gravity torques from a bar perturbation, while a small number form in response to a mild tidal interaction with a nearby companion. In either case, a resonance is a very special place in any galaxy where star formation can be enhanced and may proceed either as a starburst or continuously over a long time period. Resonance rings are natural dynamical laboratories for star cluster formation and evolution. We are proposing here to study star formation in two galaxies where we feel certain that the rings are resonance rings with a different origin. NGC 3081 has four excellent star-forming rings that are easily connected to bar- driven gas dynamics, while NGC 4622 is a nonbarred spiral where a strong inner ring is easily connected to a tidal interaction. We wish to isolate the young clusters in the rings of these two galaxies, measure their ages and luminosity functions, examine the properties of the background starlight, and use the information to trace the dynamics of these galaxies and understand the interplay between perturbations, gas dynamics, and star formation in normal galaxies.

Category: GALAXIES.  We propose to constrain the origin of spiral galaxy halos by studying stellar populations near the tip of the red giant branch. This will be the first systematic study of this population in external galaxies and will quadruple the sample of normal spiral galaxies for which the halo metallicity distribution function is measured. This larger sample will permit us to study the relationship between the bulge, disk, and halo components and between halos and globular systems. Such correlations will in turn provide indications as to whether the halo, bulge, and globular cluster systems built up nearly simultaneously in the early universe or were accreted over time through different kinds of merging events.

Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  The M81 group is one of the nearest groups of galaxies to ourown but its properties are quite different from that of theLocal Group.  It has therefore provided a differentevolutionary environment for its member galaxies. This teamhas carried out a CCD survey of the M81 group to search foranalogs to the Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies.We have recovered all of the M81 dwarf candidates previouslyidentified in photographic surveys and, in addition, havediscovered six new systems whose surface brightnesses andapparent sizes place them within the range of values found forthe Local Group dSphs.  In this proposal we request HST timeto image two of the candidate M81 group dSph systems. Theproposed observations will allow construction of color-magnitude diagrams covering the upper two magnitudes of thered giant branch and will allow a determination of theirdistance (via the luminosity of the giant branch tip), anestimate of their mean abundance (via the mean giant branchcolor) and a first estimate of their star formation history(via the frequency of occurrence of upper-AGB stars).Comparison of these results with those for the Local GroupdSphs will then help define the dependence of the formationand evolution of these low luminosity galaxies on the localconditions.

The recent detection of H_2O masers in an edge-on diskorbiting a massive black hole in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC4258 (Miyoshi et al. 1995) represents a fundamental stepforward in our understanding of the structure of activegalactic nuclei.	Ground-based imaging- and spectro-polarimetry obtained by us during the past year have extendedthis result with the discovery of a featureless nuclearcontinuum and 1000 km s^-1-wide emission lines, polarizedpresumably by scattering in a toroidal geometry.  Thepolarization position angle is identical to the elongation ofthe maser disk on the sky, establishing a direct link betweenthe geometry of an obscuring torus in an active galaxy andmaterial orbiting a compact object of high mass.  We proposeto obtain small-aperture UV spectroscopy andspectropolarimetry of the nucleus of NGC 4258 to isolate thisscattered AGN spectrum from the surrounding starlight.  Thiswill be used to measure the nonthermal spectral shape andluminosity, and search for scattered UV emission lines.  Inaddition, ultraviolet images obtained with WFPC2 will becompared with existing Cycle 4 optical continuum and emission-line images to search for the ionizing cones which areexpected to be produced by radiation escaping along the axisof the torus.	Unfortunately, high-resolution imagingpolarimetry must await the installation of the Advanced Camerain 1999.
Category: QUASAR ABSORPTION LINES AND IGM.  We propose to conduct a spectroscopic survey of Lyman limit absorbers at redshifts 1.8 < z < 2.5, using WFC3 and the G280 grism.  This proposal intends to complete an approved Cycle 15 SNAP program {#10878} which was cut short due to the ACS failure.  We have selected 64 quasars at 2.3 < z < 2.6 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Spectroscopic Quasar sample, for which no BAL signature is found at the QSO redshift and no strong metal absorption lines are present at z > 2.3 along the lines of sight.  The survey has three main observational goals.  First, we will determine the redshift frequency dn/dz of the LLS over the column density range 16.0 < log{NHI} < 20.3 cm^-2.  Second, we will measure the column density frequency distribution f{N} for the partial Lyman limit systems {PLLS} over the column density range 16.0 < log{NHI} < 17.5 cm^-2.  Third, we will identify those sightlines which could provide a measurement of the primordial D/H ratio.  By carrying out this survey, we can also help place meaningful constraints on two key quantities of cosmological relevance.  First, we will estimate the amount of metals in the LLS using the f{N}, and ground based observations of metal line transitions.	Second, by determining f{N} of the PLLS, we can constrain the amplitude of the ionizing UV background at z~2 to a greater precision.  This survey is ideal for a snapshot observing program, because the on-object integration times are all well below 30 minutes, and follow-up observations from the ground require minimal telescope time due to the QSO sample being bright.

Category: None.  Star forming regions contain many resolved structures, ranging from disks around individual stars to narrow and wide binaries to large-scale outflows, bubbles and shock fronts traversing the entire cloud. In many cases, optical high-resolution imaging is the best tool to find and study these objects. We propose a pure-parallel survey, where no primary orbits are allocated and instead or observations are performed on whatever happens to be in the field-of-view of the WFC3 or ACS when other programs use STIS or COS on targets in star forming regions. In this way, we can survey a large area to discover (i) previously unresolved companions, (ii) jets and outflows from young stars and (iii) irradiated and evaporating disks. Typically, such imaging studies are done in the most "interesting" regions close to the most massive and brightest stars. Our survey can complement that by imaging more "typical" parts of the cloud. We will use a combination of broad-band filters to detect nebulosity and identify and separate point sources as well as narrow-band filters in emission lines typically seen from irradiated disks, jets, and outflows.

Category: GALAXIES.  Because Lyman-alpha photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen, the strength and spatial extent of Lya emission in galaxies depend on the HI column density and covering fraction, properties that are of primary interest to the escape of ionizing radiation. Lya emission is particularly important to the study of low mass, low metallicity galaxies: such objects are likely to be responsible for the reionization of the universe, and Lya emission is more common in these galaxies. With this proposal, we request 7 orbits of WFC3/UVIS imaging to obtain a high resolution map of Lya emission in the low mass, low metallicity z=1.85 gravitationally lensed galaxy SL2SJ021737-051329. With oxygen abundance <10% of solar, stellar mass <10^8 Msun, and extremely strong Lya emission with rest-frame equivalent width ~120 A, this object is a prime example of a low mass Lya-emitter, and its gravitational magnification by a factor of ~35 results in remarkably high WFC3/UVIS spatial resolution of ~20 pc. Existing HST broadband and IR grism observations will allow us to compare the spatial extent of the Lya emission with both the rest-frame UV continuum and the rest-frame optical nebular line emission, in order to map the resonant scattering of Lya photons from their origin in star-forming regions, obtain constraints on the location of the scattering gas, and relate this information to the kinematics and geometry of the galaxy. The proposed observations, in combination with the spectroscopic information we have already obtained, will provide the most comprehensive and highest resolution picture of Lya emission at z > 1 to date.
Category: .  As the most massive objects in the universe, galaxy clusters represent important signposts in our story of structure evolution, and are the ultimate telescopic lenses, placing gravitationally lensed galaxies from the earliest epochs in comfortable reach for careful study. We take full advantage of the refurbished ACS and WFC3 cameras to deliver deep 14-filter images of 25 carefully chosen clusters. These will enable us to address timely and substantive questions about dark matter, dark energy, and galaxy evolution well beyond z=7. These X-ray clusters are chosen to be free of lensing bias and to span a wide range of redshift and mass. By combining strong and weak lensing, we will obtain the definitive mass profile of relaxed clusters to confront the distinctive prediction of the standard LambdaCDM model. Detailed maps of internal structure will be enabled by ~1,000 new multiply-imaged lensed sources to AB=26, all with precise {2% x {1+z}} photometric redshift measurements, thanks to WFC3's UV and IR coverage.  A supernovae search in parallel {with low magnification uncertainties} will extend the Hubble diagram of SN1a to z>1.5, testing the constancy of dark energy with time and probing progenitor evolution. Our homogeneous panchromatic deep imaging of this cluster sample will constitute a vast legacy archive for studies of the formation and evolution of structure.

Category: SOLAR SYSTEM.  We propose a systematic imaging and spectroscopicinvestigation of comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp). The comet willbe monitored over a wide range of heliocentric distances,providing unique information on the sublimation behavior ofthis unusual object. The images will be used to placesensitive constraints on the size of the nucleus, search forpossible companion nuclei, and examine the near-nucleus comamorphology for evidence of jets and shells. Spectroscopicexposures will allow us to place constraints on the source ofcometary activity at large heliocentric distance and detectthe onset of water sublimation.  If near-perihelionobservations are permitted, we will conduct deep searches fornew species at unprecedented sensitivity, compile an inventoryof the important C-, H-, N-, O-, and S-bearing species in thenucleus, measure the OD/OH ratio, and possibly even physicallyresolve the nucleus. If this comet achieves its expectedbrightness, the quality of the HST near-perihelion data willtruly be spectacular and will provide fundamental, newinsights into the nature of comets.
Category: SOLAR SYSTEM.  This is the continuation of GO 6621 {PI: M. A'Hearn} which received long-term {2-year} status in cycle 6 to observe the periodic comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, the parent of the Leonid meteor stream, whose forthcoming return provides a very rare opportunity to study the nucleus of a P/Halley class comet {P = 33 yr, aphelion = 20 AU} and the relationship of cometary ejection processes to a major meteor stream. The comet comes to perihelion in cycle 7 with an unusually close approach to Earth 40 days before, on 17 January 1998. At the geocentric distance of 0.45 AU, the Planetary Camera will achieve a spatial resolution {2 pixels} of 30 km allowing light from the nucleus to be clearly distinguished from light due to the surrounding coma. Understanding the expected meteor storm in the Leonid shower requires knowledge of the comet's nuclear properties. We plan to measure the B, V, R, I magnitudes of the nucleus in order to derive its color, and we plan to study its rotational properties by measuring its projected cross sections as a function of time. Concurent thermal infrared observations {ISOCAM, ground-based infrared camera} will allow to derive its albedo and in turn its size with very minimal asumptions. The HST images will also enable us to study the circum-nuclear region, in particular, the relationship of the nuclear outgassing and the physical properties of the dust {e.g., its color} to the nuclear rotation. We expect to image possible dust structures and to possibly map the sources of dust on the nucleus.

Category: SOLAR SYSTEM.  We propose to carry out high-resolution imaging of the near-nuclearregions of comet Hyakutake to determine the structure and evolution of theplasma.	These images will determine the nature of the comet's interactionwith the solar wind, show the morphology of the comet's magnetic field,provide insight to mechanisms for disconnection events (DE's), and assist indetermining the important mechanism for ionizing molecules in comets.  Theinteraction of the solar wind with comets -- capture of solar magnetic fieldlines, formation of the plasma tail, formation of rays, activity includingdisconnection events, ionization of molecules -- is widely believed tofollow a standard paradigm. None of the features of the paradigm have beenverified for nuclear distances less than about 1000 km or with spatialresolutions comparable to the expected dimension of fine structure.  Thisdimension is the Larmor radius of water ions; for this case, about 15 km.For a comet with a geocentric distance of 1 AU, each WFC-2 chip willcover about 55,000 km on a side, with a resolution of 72 km.	Such animage would provide, by far, the most stringent test of our physical viewof the comet/solar wind interaction.  These observations require a cometof total visual magnitude 10 or less, the preferred target being a newcomet of magnitude 7 or less.

Category: SOLAR SYSTEM INNER PLANETS.  We propose to use WF/PC-II to make high-resolution observations of the surface and atmosphere of Mars.  These observations will employ the new capabilities the WF/PC-II including the novel Linear Ramp Filters and improved FUV performance to place more stringent constraints on the atmospheric water, ozone, airborne dust, surface optical properties and iron mineralogy.  We propose to conduct these observations during mid February 1995, when Mars is near opposition.  The proposed observing period will overlap with the nominal mission of the Mars Observer spacecraft.  The WF/PC-II UV, VIS, and NIR capabilities will complement the planned observations by the Mars Observer Camera (MOC), the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR) and the Thermal emission Spectrometer (TES).
