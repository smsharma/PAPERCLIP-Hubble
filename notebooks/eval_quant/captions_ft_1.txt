Category: Stellar Populations.  Dwarf galaxies are excellent test particles for studying dynamical properties of the Local Group (LG) and the role of environment in quenching of star formation in low-mass galaxies. In this context, galaxies at the edge of the LG are of particular interest. They enable an estimate of the mass of the LG throught the radius of the turn-around surface. However, how dwarfs can be located at such large distances from the barycenter of the LG is still an open question. It may be that these galaxies are on their first infall into the LG potential well. Alternatively, they may have been close to their first orbital apocenter when the LG decoupled from the Hubble flow, the so-called splashback radius. Depending on this issue, the enviroment the dwarfs have moved through can be quite different. This environment also affects their star formation history through e.g. quenching. Here we propose to measure proper motions (PM) 4 dwarfs located at the edge of the LG: 2 dwarf irregulars (LeoA and Sag dIrr) and 2 dwarf spheroidals (Cetus and Tucana). These are the only dwarfs at the edge of the Local Group with first epoch archival data for PM measurements and star formation history determination. We will construct full three-dimensional velocity vectors, trace back their orbits, calculate the LG Mass, and determine whether past interactions with the MW or M31 can explain their different morphologies and star-formation histories.

Category: STELLAR POPS.  High-precision astrometry throughout the Milky Way halo is a unique capability of HST, with potential for transformative science, including constraining the nature of dark matter, probing the epoch of reionization, and understanding key physics of galaxy formation. While Gaia will provide unparalleled astrometric precision for bright stars in the inner halo of the Milky Way, HST is the only current mission capable of measuring (1) accurate orbital proper motions for systems at greater distances (> 80 kpc), in order to measure the total mass profile of the Milky Way, or (2) internal kinematics of stars in dwarf galaxies, to test the cusp versus core nature of their inner density profiles. We propose to initiate the next-generation, high-precision, proper-motion survey of all known dwarf galaxies within the Milky Way halo, thus laying the foundation to dynamically map the nearby Universe in full 6-D orbital phase space. Specifically, we propose to use ACS/WFC3 to establish a first-epoch baseline for proper-motion measurements for the 32 known dwarf galaxies within 420 kpc that currently lack sufficient first-epoch imaging. These observations will provide the critical anchor point for forefront scientific results within the next 4 years of HST's life, which can be extended with future missions, including JWST, over 10+ years to obtain unprecedented astrometric accuracy, ensuring that HST leaves a unique and lasting legacy for decades to come.

Category: QUASAR ABSORPTION LINES AND IGM.  We propose HST-COS spectroscopy of 10 quasars behind M31. Absorption lines due to MgII, FeII, CIV, and a variety of other lines will be searched for and measured. Six quasars lie between 1 and 4.2 Holmberg radii near the major axis on the southwest side, where confusion with Milky Way gas is minimized. Two lie even farther out on the southwest side of the major axis. One lies within 1 Holmberg radius. Two of the 10 pass through M31's high velocity clouds seen in a detailed 21 cm emission map. Exposure time estimates were based on SDSS magnitudes and available GALEX magnitudes. Thus, using the most well-studied external spiral galaxy in the sky, our observations will permit us to check, better than ever before, the standard picture that quasar metal-line absorption systems such as MgII and CIV arise in an extended gaseous halo/disk of a galaxy well beyond its observable optical radius. The observations will yield insights into the nature of the gas and its connection to the very extended stellar components of M31 that have recently been studied. Notably the observations have the potential of extending M31's rotation curve to very large galactocentric distances, thereby placing new constrants on M31's dark matter halo.  Finally, we also request that the coordinated parallel orbits be allocated to this program so that we may image the resolved stellar content of M31's halo and outer disk.
Category: Galaxies and the IGM.  Spiral galaxies dominate the stellar mass density in the Universe, yet the details of their formation and evolution are still greatly debated. The simulations based on the current cosmological model show that these galaxies grow in mass through accretion and mergers. One of the consequence of this galaxy assembly process is the formation of an old, metal-poor stellar halo. However, to date the presence of a spheroidal component in low-mass spirals is elusive and controversial, mostly due to the difficulty to detect such a faint, diffuse component amid the foreground/background contamination. We propose a novel method to detect and characterize such a halo in the nearby, edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 55, that by-passes these limitations by using the pulsational properties of its RR Lyrae stars. These observations will allow us to i) firmly establish the presence of an old stellar halo, ii) quantify its early chemical evolution, and iii) determine the nature of its building blocks. We will use the resulting deep color-magnitude diagrams reaching 1.5 magnitudes below the horizontal-branch to test halo and thick disk formation models.
