Category: HOT STARS.  We propose to obtain second epoch imaging of the globular cluster NGC 6397, which has the deepest ACS/WFC dataset {126 orbits in Cycle 13} ever obtained in a globular cluster.	 These additional 14 orbits would enable the construction of a proper motion - cleaned white dwarf cooling sequence reaching fainter than the observed truncation point of the white dwarf luminosity function; a byproduct will be absolute proper motions {relative to the extragalactic reference frame} of the rich spheroid field population.  Our data shows the long sought ``blue hook'',  a feature in the WD cooling sequence predicted in theoretical white dwarf models; the improved photometry and statistics afforded by the second epoch observations are needed to confirm the blue hook and to test other aspects of white dwarf cooling models that contribute to a 0.5 Gyr or greater uncertainty in the age.  The proposed observations will provide formal constraints on the age and formation timescale of NGC 6397 that will be smaller than 1 Gyr and place the cluster's formation epoch relative to the end of reionization.  The final proper motion-purified white dwarf sequence will be a powerful constraint for white dwarf cooling models and atmospheres, the basis for white dwarf-based globular cluster age determinations, and also constrain the fraction of binary white dwarfs.

Category: HOT STARS.  We propose WFPC2 imaging of four white dwarf companions to binary neutron stars for use in radio/optical frame tie measurements. Multiple exposures spaced by several minutes will permit detection of variability due to rotation or pulsation of the white dwarf. Most critically, the astrometry will enable us to measure the rotation of the optical reference frame relative to the radio and dynamical reference frames made from independent pulsar observations. These observations will have direct ties with on going radio pulsar timing experiments and planned very long baseline interferometry observations using the VLBA. As an added benefit the astrometric observations can be used with a second set of observations two Cycles later to measure proper motion of the white dwarfs. Proper motion observations can be used to distinguish between supernova and accretion induced collapse models for the two white-dwarf millisecond pulsars, and provide improved astrometry for all four white dwarf pulsar systems.
