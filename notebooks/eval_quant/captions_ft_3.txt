Category: COSMOLOGY.  We propose the continuation of our highly successful ACS+WFC3 SNAPshot survey of a sample of 125 very X-ray luminous clusters in the redshift range 0.3-0.7, detected and compiled by the MACS cluster survey. As demonstrated by ACS/WFC3 SNAPshots of 63 MACS clusters obtained by us in previous Cycles {14 of them in all of F606W, F814W, F110W, and F140W}, dedicated HST observations of the 12 most distant MACS clusters {GO-09722}, and the CLASH MCT programme, these systems are highly efficient gravitational lenses as well as ideal targets for studies of galaxy evolution in dense environments.  Our primary science goals are a} the discovery of additional bright, giant arcs for resolved, in-depth, spectroscopic study with 8-10m telescopes, b} the selection of Distant Red Galaxies as well as z>6 galaxies as F814W dropouts, and c} the identification of extremely luminous but optically faint submm galaxies at z=2-5 detected in our Herschel/SPIRE observations of this sample. In addition, the proposed observations will d} provide important constraints on the mass distributions in these extreme systems, and e} improve our understanding of the physical nature of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-gas interactions in cluster cores.  In recognition of the particular value of WFC3 images for our primary science goals {so far, only 21 WFC3/SNAPs have been executed}, we stagger the proposed visits such that SNAPshots in the WFC3/F110W and F140W passbands will be executed first, followed by ACS observations in the F606W and F814W filters. The images thus obtained will build a dataset of legacy value for a wide range of extragalactic research topics.
Category: .  As the most massive objects in the universe, galaxy clusters represent important signposts in our story of structure evolution, and are the ultimate telescopic lenses, placing gravitationally lensed galaxies from the earliest epochs in comfortable reach for careful study. We take full advantage of the refurbished ACS and WFC3 cameras to deliver deep 14-filter images of 25 carefully chosen clusters. These will enable us to address timely and substantive questions about dark matter, dark energy, and galaxy evolution well beyond z=7. These X-ray clusters are chosen to be free of lensing bias and to span a wide range of redshift and mass. By combining strong and weak lensing, we will obtain the definitive mass profile of relaxed clusters to confront the distinctive prediction of the standard LambdaCDM model. Detailed maps of internal structure will be enabled by ~1,000 new multiply-imaged lensed sources to AB=26, all with precise {2% x {1+z}} photometric redshift measurements, thanks to WFC3's UV and IR coverage.  A supernovae search in parallel {with low magnification uncertainties} will extend the Hubble diagram of SN1a to z>1.5, testing the constancy of dark energy with time and probing progenitor evolution. Our homogeneous panchromatic deep imaging of this cluster sample will constitute a vast legacy archive for studies of the formation and evolution of structure.

Category: COSMOLOGY.  In spite of recent progress, the role of distant galaxies in cosmic reionization has been difficult to pin down. A powerful way to make progress is to move beyond counting high redshift sources and study the stellar properties of the population instead. Accurate knowledge of the average star formation density and its recent history in the universe at this epoch is necessary to determine whether these galaxies emit enough hard photons to reionize the Universe. SURFS UP is a Spitzer Exploration Science program (PI Bradac) designed to measure stellar masses and ages of galaxies at z >~ 7 and identify the dominant sources of the bulk of ionizing photons necessary to drive reionization. The last observations were completed in March 2014. The program uses 10 galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes to study galaxies at intrinsically lower luminosities than blank field surveys of the same exposure time. All clusters but one have both extremely deep HST and Spitzer data available. The last cluster (MACS2214) is lacking HST WFC3-IR data which are crucial to select galaxies at z >~ 7, to study their instantaneous star formation rate via rest-frame UV, and to study their evolved population via rest-frame optical. We request here 5 orbits of WFC3-IR data, which will be a crucial complement to the existing extremely deep Spitzer and HST-ACS data for MACS2214, as well as to the entire SURFS UP sample. The proposal will double the number of currently detected sub-L* galaxies at z>~7 that have been detected by Spitzer and for which we can measure stellar masses and ages. The request of 5 orbits will strongly increase the legacy value of SURFS UP and we waive any proprietary rights.
Category: COSMOLOGY.  The brightest, strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies are veritable gems to study intense star formation in the early Universe. How do the high and irregular "clumpy" stellar and gas mass surface densities, strong radiation fields, and high turbulence regulate the rapid growth of these galaxies?  We will use HST/WFC3 to investigate the stellar component of 6 of the brightest high-redshift sub-millimeter galaxies on the sky, which were recently discovered with the Planck all-sky survey. All are giant arcs or partial Einstein rings with angular sizes up to 17" in shallow CFHT K-band or Spitzer/IRAC imaging. FIR luminosities are 10^13-14 L_sun, with dust SEDs strongly dominated by intense star formation near the maximum possible rates ("maximal starbursts"). All have spectroscopic redshifts z=2.2-3.6 and magnification factors >/=20. We already have multiwavelength data sets to characterize their gas and dust column densities and kinematics, and propose here to acquire deep, high-resolution rest-frame optical imaging to study the stellar populations and morphologies. With WFC3 imaging in F110W & F160W we will:  (1) constrain the stellar morphologies, ages, and mass-to-light ratios  (2) Identify clumps and measure their properties to test several clump formation scenarios  (3) Enhance our on-going lens modeling through the most accurate positions, morphologies and colors  Only the brightest of the arc clumps are visible from the ground in the NIR. To register the flux along the full extent of the arcs, and importantly to probe individual star forming regions of the size of 30 Dor at z~2-3 in the brightest high-z sub-mm galaxies requires HST.

Category: COSMOLOGY.  HST is now uniquely capable of measuring the time variation of dark energy (DE) using supernovae (SNe) - and to address the recent surprising low DE density measured at very high redshift by BAO. The MCT survey has shown that field SN rates at z>1 are too low to accomplish this, but it can be done with a search for SNe in massive clusters.  Based on the high SN rate found in our ACS-NICMOS SN cluster survey, we propose a cadenced two-cycle SN survey of 10 of the most massive known clusters at z = 1.1 to 1.75. We expect to accurately measure ~30 Type Ia SNe at these redshifts. The exquisite sensitivity of WFC3 ensures that each SN will have the high S/N color measurements necessary to provide the necessary control of the dominant astrophysical systematics so we can measure the density history of DE over the largest possible z range.  With this calibration, our SN results at z>1 will be limited by statistical rather than systematic errors.  This unique cluster data set will also be used for numerous key cosmology questions:  Weak lensing (WL) cluster-masses derived from our imaging will allow the first calibration of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)-mass relation at z > 1 at the level of precision required to make SZ derived masses competitive as strong measurements of DE.  For the main science goal of this proposal, we can shrink the uncertainty on DE density at z>1 below +/- 0.6 - and be able distinguish the recent BAO low-density result from a cosmological constant at almost 3 sigma. We improve the uncertainty on DE equation of state w at redshifts z > 0.5 by a factor of three using SNe alone, and by combining the SN and WL results, double the DETF Figure of Merit to over 100.
