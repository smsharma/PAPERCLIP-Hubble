Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  As the closest star forming dwarf galaxy, the SMC is the preferred location for detailed studies of this extremely common class of objects. We therefore propose to use the capabilities of ACS, which provide an improvement by an order of magnitude over what is possible with ground-based optical imaging surveys that are limited by confusion anddepth, to measure key stellar population parameters in the SMC from VI color-magnitude diagrams. Our program focuses on regions where crowding makes HST essential and includes 7 star clusters and 7 field star locations. We will measure accurate ages of the clusters, test stellar evolution models, gain fiducial stellar sequences to use in fitting the field stars, check the form of the IMF, and substantially extend the study of RR Lyrae variables in the key NGC121 SMC globular cluster. The field pointings will allow us to reconstruct the star formation history, look for enhanced star formation that is expected when the SMC interacts with the LMC and/or Milky Way, and compare its main sequence luminosity {and mass} functions with those of the Milky Way, LMC, and UMi dwarf spheroidal. This proposal is part of a coordinated HST and ground-based study of the stellar history and star formation processes in the SMC.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  We propose to make observations that directly test the proposition that globular clusters contain massive black holes. Our targets are the bulge globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. These are probably among the most massive  in the galaxy, but are understudied compared to more familiar objects such as M15. Our analysis suggests that these two clusters are the most likely to show unambiguous evidence for a central massive black hole if such things exist in globular clusters. The observations proposed will give us the first thorough kinematic and photometric studies of these two clusters. The combination of the two epochs will give us proper motions good to of order 6 km/s. In addition, they will provide us with the first good, deep, color-magnitude diagrams for these clusters. These diagrams will be used to investigate the make up of the stellar population in the clusters, to more firmly establish their distances, ages, and metallicities, and to search for a binary sequence.

Category: .  We propose to calibrate the geometric distortion of the WFC and HRC of ACS, using the state-of-the-art techniques that we have developed for WFPC2. We are confident that we can measure the distortion to at least an order or magnitude higher accuracy than is called for in the ACS Manual. We will use the images that are to be taken in GO-9028 and will re- image the field used there at different orientation and through different filters, so as to improve knowledge of the skewness of the field and the dependence of distortion on wavelength. Our results will not only enhance the accuracy of our own proposed proper-motion work in star clusters; they will greatly increase the accuracy of sparse-field astrometry by others, such as solar-sytem and extragalactic work.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS IN CLUSTERS.  Knowledge of star formation in old populations is a vital ingredient in understanding galactic evolution. Globular star clusters offer the possibility of observing the mass functions of homogeneous old stellar populations. Those for which reliable mass functions have been determined already, however, have generally been subject to dynamical evolution {relaxation, escape of stars, and tidal shocks}, so that the observed mass function is not primordial. We have therefore examined tables of properties of globular clusters in order to choose those that are least likely to have suffered from relaxation, escape, and tidal shocks. We propose two new targets {NGC 2808 and M53}, and dynamical rediscussion of existing data on one other {M3}. To minimize mass-segregation corrections, in each cluster we will select a field at the radius where the local mass function most closely resembles the global mass function. The range of metallicities of the targets will also allow us to estimate the influence of metallicity on the IMF. The team has leading-edge expertise in all the techniques required: making the observations and reducing them to luminosity functions, converting to mass functions, and all types of dynamical modeling, which are required to make the small corrections to global and then initial mass functions.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Stellar Populations Part III: Globular Cluster Cores.	The cores of 2 globular clusters will be imaged in U to study core properties and search for collapsed cusps.  The clusters are relatively nearby and span the range from very regular to very cusplike.
Category: BINARY STARS.  The ultimate test for the total number and characteristics of cataclysmic variables {CVs} and compact binaries in the core of a globular cluster can best be conducted on the closest collapsed core cluster, NGC 6397. We propose to use our proven successful method of deep H Alpha {F656N} and R {F675W} imaging with WFPC2 to identify essentially all CV candidates down to M_V ~ 12. This extends our WFPC1 discovery of emission line candidates in NGC6397, confirmed as CVs with FOS spectra, to virtually the entire CV luminosity function including the faintest magnetic systems which our FOS results suggest may be dominant in globulars. With interwoven V and I frames, we shall also constrain the CV disk vs. secondary star colors and thus masses of the secondary star and WD {lower limit}, allow for short-term variability searches, and constrain the {primordial} main sequence binary population for direct comparison with other clusters {e.g. NGC 6752}. Comparison with our deep ROSAT HRI image will identify still fainter dim x-ray sources as well as provide the optical identification data for our planned GTO observations of NGC 6397 with AXAF.
