Category: QUASAR ABSORPTION LINES AND IGM.  We propose HST-COS spectroscopy of 10 quasars behind M31. Absorption lines due to MgII, FeII, CIV, and a variety of other lines will be searched for and measured. Six quasars lie between 1 and 4.2 Holmberg radii near the major axis on the southwest side, where confusion with Milky Way gas is minimized. Two lie even farther out on the southwest side of the major axis. One lies within 1 Holmberg radius. Two of the 10 pass through M31's high velocity clouds seen in a detailed 21 cm emission map. Exposure time estimates were based on SDSS magnitudes and available GALEX magnitudes. Thus, using the most well-studied external spiral galaxy in the sky, our observations will permit us to check, better than ever before, the standard picture that quasar metal-line absorption systems such as MgII and CIV arise in an extended gaseous halo/disk of a galaxy well beyond its observable optical radius. The observations will yield insights into the nature of the gas and its connection to the very extended stellar components of M31 that have recently been studied. Notably the observations have the potential of extending M31's rotation curve to very large galactocentric distances, thereby placing new constrants on M31's dark matter halo.  Finally, we also request that the coordinated parallel orbits be allocated to this program so that we may image the resolved stellar content of M31's halo and outer disk.
Category: STELLAR POPS.  High-precision astrometry throughout the Milky Way halo is a unique capability of HST, with potential for transformative science, including constraining the nature of dark matter, probing the epoch of reionization, and understanding key physics of galaxy formation. While Gaia will provide unparalleled astrometric precision for bright stars in the inner halo of the Milky Way, HST is the only current mission capable of measuring (1) accurate orbital proper motions for systems at greater distances (> 80 kpc), in order to measure the total mass profile of the Milky Way, or (2) internal kinematics of stars in dwarf galaxies, to test the cusp versus core nature of their inner density profiles. We propose to initiate the next-generation, high-precision, proper-motion survey of all known dwarf galaxies within the Milky Way halo, thus laying the foundation to dynamically map the nearby Universe in full 6-D orbital phase space. Specifically, we propose to use ACS/WFC3 to establish a first-epoch baseline for proper-motion measurements for the 32 known dwarf galaxies within 420 kpc that currently lack sufficient first-epoch imaging. These observations will provide the critical anchor point for forefront scientific results within the next 4 years of HST's life, which can be extended with future missions, including JWST, over 10+ years to obtain unprecedented astrometric accuracy, ensuring that HST leaves a unique and lasting legacy for decades to come.

Category: RESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Models of galaxy formation in a cosmological context predict that massive disk galaxies should have richly-structured extended stellar halos, containing ~10% of a galaxy's stars, originating in large part from the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies. Observations of a number of nearby disk galaxies have generally agreed with these expectations.  Recent new observations in integrated light with a novel array of low scattered-light telephoto lenses have failed to convincingly detect a stellar halo in the nearby massive face-on disk galaxy M101 (van Dokkum et al. 2014). They argue that any halo has to have <0.3% of the mass of the galaxy. This halo would be the least massive of any massive disk galaxy in the local Universe (by factors of several) -- such a halo is not predicted or naturally interpreted by the models, and would present a critical challenge to the picture of ubiquitous stellar halos formed from the debris of disrupting dwarf galaxies.  We propose to resolve the stellar populations of this uniquely anemic stellar halo for 6 orbits with HST (ACS and WFC3), allowing us to reach surface brightness limits sufficient to clearly detect and characterize M101's stellar halo if it carries more than 0.1% of M101's mass. With resolved stellar populations, we can use the gradient of stellar populations as a function of radius to separate stellar halo from disk, which is impossible using integrated light observations. The resolved stellar populations will reveal the halo mass to much greater accuracy, measure the halo radial profile, constrain any halo lopsidedness, estimate the halo's stellar metallicity, and permit an analysis of outer disk stellar populations.

Category: RESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Stellar streams in the Milky Way {MW} support the view that much of its halo was formed hierarchically via the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. These streams are unique dynamical tracers of the dark matter halo, and provide strong tests of galaxy formation models. The Orphan Stream, discovered in the SDSS survey area, is closer, colder, and fainter than the better known Sagittarius {Sgr} Stream, and it has no known parent galaxy. It therefore allows a study of the less-massive objects that built up the MW halo. Lack of proper motion {PM} data limits our understanding of stream orbits and MW dark halo properties. HST's excellent astrometric accuracy can now address this, as demonstrated by our ongoing Sgr Stream study. We propose here to map the PM variation along the Orphan Stream. We will target four fields with ACS/WFC for which serendipitous first-epoch observations exist in the Archive with 10-12 yr time baselines. PM accuracies near 6 km/s will be achieved by measuring the relative motion between stream stars and background galaxies, using techniques developed by us for other successful PM programs {e.g., LMC/SMC, Leo I, M31}. We will interpret the results using dynamical calculations and N-body models, using our techniques already developed for modeling the Sgr and Magellanic Streams. Our study will yield the orbit of the Orphan Stream, which in turn may allow us to identify its progenitor {if not already entirely disrupted}. The orbit will also strongly constrain the shape and mass of the MW dark halo, especially when combined with our ongoing studies of other streams.
Category: UNRESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS AND GALAXY STRUCTUR.  The structure and evolution of giant elliptical galaxies provide key quantitative tests for the theory of hierarchical galaxy formation in a cold dark matter dominated universe.  Strong gravitational lensing provides the only direct means for the measurement of individual elliptical galaxy masses beyond the local universe, but there are currently no large and homogeneous samples of strong lens galaxies at significant cosmological look-back time. Hence, an accurate and unambiguous measurement of the evolution of the mass-density structure of elliptical galaxies has until now been impossible. Using spectroscopic data from the recently initiated Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey {BOSS} of luminous elliptical galaxies at redshifts from approximately 0.4 to 0.7, we have identified a large sample of high-probability strong gravitational lens candidates at significant cosmological look-back time, based on the detection of emission-line features from more distant galaxies along the same lines of sight as the target ellipticals.  We propose to observe 45 of these systems with the ACS-WFC in order to confirm the incidence of lensing and to measure the masses of the lens galaxies.	We will complement these lensing mass measurements with stellar velocity dispersions from ground-based follow-up spectroscopy.	In combination with similar data from the Sloan Lens ACS {SLACS} Survey at lower redshifts, we will directly measure the cosmic evolution of the ratio between lensing mass and dynamical mass, to reveal the structural explanation for the observed size evolution of elliptical galaxies {at high mass}.	We will also measure the evolution of the logarithmic mass-density profile of massive ellipticals, which is sensitive to the details of the merging histories through which they are assembled.  Finally, we will use our lensing mass-to-light measurements to translate the BOSS galaxy luminosity function into a mass function, and determine its evolution in combination with data from the original Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
