Category: AGN/QUASARS.  Using archival HST and Chandra observations of 34 nearby early-type galaxies {drawn from a complete radio selected sample} we have found evidence that the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy is directly connected to the structure of the inner regions of their host galaxies in the following sense: [1] Radio-loud AGN are associated with galaxies with shallow cores in their light profiles [2] Radio-quiet AGN are only hosted by galaxies with steep cusps. Since the brightness profile is determined by the galaxy's evolution, through its merger history, our results suggest that the same process sets the AGN flavour. This provides us with a novel tool to explore the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, and it opens a new path to understand the origin of the radio-loud/radio-quiet AGN dichotomy. Currently our analysis is statistically incomplete as the brightness profile is not available for 82 of the 116 targets. Most galaxies were not observed with HST, while in some cases the study is obstructed by the presence of dust features. We here propose to perform an infrared NICMOS snapshot survey of these 82 galaxies. This will enable us to i} test the reality of the dichotomic behaviour in a substantially larger sample; ii} extend the comparison between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN to a larger range of luminosities.
Category: Large Scale Structure of the Universe.  Surface brightness fluctuations in E/S0 galaxies are sufficiently bright in the infrared that they can be recorded with high signal-to-noise in galaxies within 80 Mpc in a single HST orbit.  The SBF luminosity dependence on metallicity and age tracked by color is well established, permitting measurements of individual distances accurate to 5%.  This outstanding capability will be used to determine distances for SNAP targets drawn from every massive cluster and the most important E/S0 galaxies outside of massive clusters within 80 Mpc.  Galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-cluster comparisons with elliptical fundamental plane, spiral luminosity-linewidth and, especially, supernova distances will be made whereever possible in order to evaluate random and systematic uncertainties.  SBF can provide distance measures for the cosmological measurement of H0 comparable in accuracy to those of SNIa. SBF anchored by the tip of the red giant branch zero point offers a competitive and independent alternative to the Cepheid/SNIa route to H0.  The most massive clusters at 40-80 Mpc lie within either the so-called Great Attractor region or the Perseus-Pisces filament.  This range is the sweet spot for HST IR SBF studies - distances too great to be reliably measured from the ground but comfortably accessable with HST in single orbits.  The dynamics in these two complexes are in the strongly non-linear regime with clusters collapsing toward each other.  Numerical action methods will permit the recovery of physical orbits and the determination of masses.  The 3D information on positions and motions affords a unique window into the construction of rich clusters.
Category: GALAXIES.  Rings of star formation are a common phenomenon of early-type spiral galaxies. Most rings form by gas cloud collisions near resonances, under the continuous action of gravity torques from a bar perturbation, while a small number form in response to a mild tidal interaction with a nearby companion. In either case, a resonance is a very special place in any galaxy where star formation can be enhanced and may proceed either as a starburst or continuously over a long time period. Resonance rings are natural dynamical laboratories for star cluster formation and evolution. We are proposing here to study star formation in two galaxies where we feel certain that the rings are resonance rings with a different origin. NGC 3081 has four excellent star-forming rings that are easily connected to bar- driven gas dynamics, while NGC 4622 is a nonbarred spiral where a strong inner ring is easily connected to a tidal interaction. We wish to isolate the young clusters in the rings of these two galaxies, measure their ages and luminosity functions, examine the properties of the background starlight, and use the information to trace the dynamics of these galaxies and understand the interplay between perturbations, gas dynamics, and star formation in normal galaxies.

Category: Galaxies & Clusters.  We will take PC snapshots of a large, complete sample of early-type galaxies {130 galaxies in total}, with the object of examining the nuclear morphology. The survey will complement Illingworth's snapshot study of later Hubble types and provide a data base for the investigation of correlations of properties such as dust, metallicity, and colors with nuclear structure. Earlier work with the HST on the nuclear morphology of early-type galaxies has revealed that there is a clear dichotomy amongst these objects. They either have a shallow {but non-zero} surface brightness cusp, or their surface brightness continues to rise as a power-law all the way into the center, without the sign of a clear break-radius. The former we will denote as core-galaxies, while the latter will be called power-law galaxies. A number of the power-law galaxies were found to harbor small, bright, stellar disks in their nuclei. This large survey of early type galaxies will allow the investigation of the frequency of these nuclear disks. We will also investigate the relation between central cusp steepness and other parameters such as total magnitude, nuclear morphology and other galactic phenomena.
Category: GALAXIES.  Searches for supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, conducted with HST and other telescopes, have led to the discoveries that {1} most or all hot galaxies contain massive dark objects at their centers, presumably black holes; {2} there is a remarkably tight correlation between the black-hole mass and the luminosity-weighted velocity dispersion of the hot component of the galaxy. This mbh-Sigma relation has a scatter which is <0.3 dex in mbh and consistent with zero. This relationship suggests a strong link between black-hole formation, AGN activity, and galaxy formation, and once it is understood this link should advance our understanding of all three processes. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the scatter in the mbh-Sigma relation and the role of possible second parameters, by examining a sample of galaxies at fixed velocity dispersion Sigma=200+/- 20 kms. This approach decouples the effects of a second parameter from uncertainties in the shape of the mbh-Sigma relation, and minimizes spurious correlations because all of the galaxies will be studied using the same well-tested observational and modeling techniques. The sample is chosen to explore second parameters such as environment, X-ray properties, Hubble type, luminosity profile, etc. This work thus treads a path similar to the one that took us from simple bivariate relationships among galaxy properties to the deeper concept of a fundamental plane of galaxies.
Category: AGN/QUASARS.  An important new probe of the physics of large-scale radio jets is possible with the discovery of resolved X-ray/optical jets. The optical emission comes from high energy electrons, which have short radiative lifetimes and so pinpoint particle acceleration sites. Spectral energy distributions of knots in two jets suggest the X-rays come from lower energy electrons inverse-Compton scattering the {beamed} cosmic microwave background. This requires the jet to be still relativistic on kiloparsec scales {out to ~1 Mpc for the high-redshift jets.}. This model robustly constrains both the bulk relativistic speed and the minimum electron energy in the jet, which together determine the total jet power. To probe jet energetics and physics generally, and to test the ``Compton/CMB'' interpretation specifically, we propose deep HST imaging of three X-ray/optical jets {PKS 1127--145, PKS 0637--752, 3C 371} and one optical jet {PKS 2201+044}, plus Chandra observations of the latter two. The multiwavelength spectra of individual knots differ significantly, as does one jet from another, indicating the need for detailed high- resolution study of more than 1 or 2 jets. Along with the well-observed 3C 273 and M 87 jets, the 4 proposed targets are the only known {or likely} nonthermal X-ray jets readily detected with Chandra and HST.
