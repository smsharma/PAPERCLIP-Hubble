Category: RESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Multiple sequences are present in the CMD of nearly all the old Galactic globular clusters (GCs) and correspond to multiple populations with different helium and light-elements abundance. Multiple populations are not a peculiarity of old clusters, indeed extended main-sequence turn off (eMSTO) have been detected in most of the analyzed intermediate-age clusters in the Magellanic Clouds with age of ~1-2 Gyr.  The conditions under which GCs experience the formation of multiple populations remain controversial. An unique angle on this problem can be provided by the  young star clusters but the many investigations from different techniques reported no evidence for multiple populations in clusters younger than \\sim\$1\,Gyr to date. Surprisingly, we have recently discovered the first case of a \\sim\$300-Myr-old cluster with split main sequence and eMSTO. This finding has been possible thanks to the use of UVIS photometry in the appropriate F336W and F814W filters.  To properly constraint the multipopulation phenomenon in young clusters, we propose deep UVIS imaging of the \\sim\$150 Myrs-old LMC star clusters NGC1866 and NGC1755 which, according to the analysis of archive {\it HST} data are excellent candidates to host multiple populations.  The proposed observations will allow us to understand if multiple populations are present in very-young LMC clusters. We will be able to measure the age difference between the populations with errors of less than 20\,Myr and detect very small He and CNO differences. NGC1755 and NGC1866 have different masses, therefore the presence or the absence of multiple sequences in their CMDs will give information on the minimum mass required for a cluster to host multiple populations thus providing fundamental clues on the formation mechanism.
Category: RESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Planetary nebulae {PNe} in globular clusters {GCs} raise a number of interesting issues related to stellar and galactic evolution.  The number of PNe known in Milky Way GCs, four, is surprisingly low if one assumes that all stars pass through a PN stage.	However, it is likely that the remnants of stars now evolving in Galactic GCs leave the AGB so slowly that any ejected nebula dissipates long before the star becomes hot enough to ionize it. Thus there should not be ANY PNe in Milky Way GCs--but there are four!  It has been suggested that these PNe are the result of mergers of binary stars within GCs, i.e., that they are descendants of blue stragglers.  The frequency of occurrence of PNe in external galaxies poses more questions, because it shows a range of almost an order of magnitude.  I propose a Snapshot survey aimed at discovering PNe in the GC systems of Local Group galaxies outside the Milky Way.  These clusters, some of which may be much younger than their counterparts in our Galaxy, might contain many more PNe than those of our own galaxy.  I will use the standard technique of emission-line and continuum imaging, which easily discloses PNe.  This proposal continues a WFPC2 program started in Cycle 16, but with the more powerful WFC3. As a byproduct, the survey will also produce color-magnitude diagrams for numerous clusters for the first time, reaching down to the horizontal branch.

The finding that most intermediate-age (~1-2 Gyr old) star clusters in both Magellanic Clouds (MCs) exhibit an extended main-sequence turn off (eMSTO) has been one of the most-intriguing discoveries made by HST in the field of stellar astrophysics. A huge effort has been undertaken to understand the eMSTO but the physical mechanism that is responsible for the eMSTO is still unknown. Several authors have suggested that the eMSTO is due to an age spread of ~100-500 Myr and that the intermediate-age MC clusters are the young counterparts of the old Galactic globular clusters (GCs) with multiple populations. This scenario would imply that the eMSTO is present in massive GCs only. As an alternative, the eMSTO could be due to coeval stellar populations with different rotation rates. In that case the eMSTO should be unrelated to the mass of the host GC. Our recent discovery that three ~1-300 Myr-old LMC clusters exhibit not only an eMSTO but also a split MS may provide a new angle to investigate the multiple-population phenomenon. We propose to observe 9 GCs in the LMC and the SMC with ages between ~20 and ~600 Myr and masses between ~3,000 and 50,000 solar masses. This interval of masses and ages is almost unexplored to date. We plan to obtain deep imaging in the F336W and F814W bands. These are very efficient filters to search for eMSTOs and split MSs and to constrain the internal variation of age and/or the rotation rates of the distinct populations. Moreover, we will use the F656N filter to detect any H-alpha emission either due to pre-MS stars or fast-rotating Be-stars. We will thus understand to what extent age, rotation, and GC mass are responsible for the eMSTO.
Category: RESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Intermediate Mass Black Holes {IMBHs} are objects of considerable astrophysical significance, and the centers of globular clusters may be our best chance of detecting them. Tentative evidence has been presented for, e.g., G1, Omega Cen, and M54. These are all suspected to be the remnant nuclei of disrupted dwarf galaxies, with M54 residing at the center of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. IMBHs in these clusters could indicate an important connection between globular cluster black holes and the super-massive black holes known to exist in galactic nuclei. However, the line-of-sight velocity studies from which the IMBH evidence was obtained are not clear-cut. We have demonstrated that HST proper motion studies can provide much better constraints. We recently published 170,000 proper motions for Omega Cen, and our modeling of the results significantly weakened the case for an IMBH. Here we propose a similar study for M54. Ground-based spectroscopy by one of us found a peak in velocity dispersion which could be fit by either a 10^4 solar mass IMBH or an anisotropic velocity distribution; it also found a surprising offset between the kinematic and star count centers. The proposed proper motions will validate and refine our knowledge of the dispersion peak; they will directly measure the anisotropy through the ratio of radial and tangential proper motions; and they will allow an improved determination of the kinematic center from the proper motion dispersion field. We will derive a high quality proper motion catalog of thousands of stars to put strong new constraints on the M54 cluster dynamics, structure, and possible presence of an IMBH.

Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  As the closest star forming dwarf galaxy, the SMC is the preferred location for detailed studies of this extremely common class of objects. We therefore propose to use the capabilities of ACS, which provide an improvement by an order of magnitude over what is possible with ground-based optical imaging surveys that are limited by confusion anddepth, to measure key stellar population parameters in the SMC from VI color-magnitude diagrams. Our program focuses on regions where crowding makes HST essential and includes 7 star clusters and 7 field star locations. We will measure accurate ages of the clusters, test stellar evolution models, gain fiducial stellar sequences to use in fitting the field stars, check the form of the IMF, and substantially extend the study of RR Lyrae variables in the key NGC121 SMC globular cluster. The field pointings will allow us to reconstruct the star formation history, look for enhanced star formation that is expected when the SMC interacts with the LMC and/or Milky Way, and compare its main sequence luminosity {and mass} functions with those of the Milky Way, LMC, and UMi dwarf spheroidal. This proposal is part of a coordinated HST and ground-based study of the stellar history and star formation processes in the SMC.
