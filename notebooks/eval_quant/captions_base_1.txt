Category: .  The properties of the first black holes (BH) that 'seeded' the growth of supermassive BHs are poorly understood, even though these seed BHs represent critical boundary conditions for models of BH/galaxy (co)-evolution.  Local dwarf galaxies provide our best opportunity to obtain observational constraints.  Here, we propose multiwavelength Chandra, HST and VLA observations to investigate the nature of candidate nuclear BHs in three nearby dwarfs.	Our targets were recently identified within the Chandra archive, and they represent a population missed by surveys at optical wavelengths.  These observations will place new constraints on seed BH masses, and they will help inform future multiwavelength surveys for BHs in the nuclei of dwarf galaxies.
Category: .  There is growing observational and theoretical evidence to suggest that Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources {ULX} form preferentially in low metallicity environments. Here we propose a survey of 27 nearby {< 30Mpc} star-forming Extremely Metal Poor Galaxies {Z<5% solar}. There are almost no X-ray observations of such low abundance galaxies {3 in the Chandra archive}. These are the most metal-deficient galaxies known, and a logical place to find ULX if they favor metal-poor systems. We plan to test recent population synthesis models which predict that ULX should be very numerous in metal-poor galaxies. We will also test the hypothesis that ULX form in massive young star clusters, and ask for HST time to obtain the necessay imaging data.

Category: HOT STARS.  We propose to use WFC3 photometry from the near UV to the near IR to sample the bolometric light curve of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN2012cg at late times (>900 days after maximum light). This light curve will allow us to conduct a fundamental test of the theoretically predicted behavior of SN Ia light curves at late times. We will observationally determine, for the first time, whether the nuclear physics of SN Ia ejecta is solely determined by the radioactive decay of 56Co to 56Fe, or whether (and by how much) other nuclear heating mechanisms (such as the leptonic decays of 57Co and 55Fe) become discernible, as predicted.
Category: UNRESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS AND GALAXY STRUCTUR.  The Spitzer Legacy project SINGS provided a unique view of the current state of star formation and dust in a sample of galaxies of all Hubble types. This multi-wavelength view allowed the team to create current star formation diagnostics that are independent of the dust content and increased our understanding of the dust in galaxies. Even so, using the SINGS data alone we can only make rough estimates of the recent star formation history of these galaxies. The lack of U-band observations means that it is impossible to estimate the ages of young clusters. In addition, the low resolution of the Spitzer and ground-based observations means that what appear to be individual Spitzer sources can actually be composed of many individual clusters with varying ages. In this proposal we plan to address this missing area in SINGS by obtaining high-resolution WFPC2 UBVI observations to accurately find and determine the ages of the young stellar clusters in a subset of the SINGS galaxies. These observations will greatly enhance the legacy value of the SINGS observations while also directly answering questions pertaining to star formation in galaxies.
Category: Stellar Populations.  We propose to complete multi-wavelength broad- and narrow-band imaging, from the ultraviolet through the near-infrared, of a sample of 13 of the most extreme star-forming galaxies found in the nearby (D < 100 Mpc) universe. These include massive and dwarf, interacting and isolated, dusty and nearly dust-free galaxies.  The intense star formation in these galaxies can result in the formation of extremely massive young star clusters, in excess of a million solar masses, similar to the most massive known ancient globular clusters and 1-2 orders of magnitude more massive than any young cluster found in nearby quiescent/normal star-forming galaxies.  The properties of clusters and larger scale star-forming clumps in intense star-forming environments are required to address a number of outstanding issues, including whether the fraction of stars in bound clusters or the upper cutoff in cluster mass functions increases with star formation intensity, and how long the clumps survive.  Our results will differentiate between various assumptions and prescriptions for feedback used in the current generation of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.  The multi-wavelength observations will allow us to constrain dust geometry, and begin to peer through the dust to discover some of the	clusters obscured at UV and optical wavelengths, work that will be completed by JWST.  A similar suite of benchmark HST observations of normal, nearby galaxies already exists as part of the LEGUS project, and will be used as a reference to quantify the extreme star formation in our sample.
Category: Stellar Populations.  Roughly 75% of known galaxies confirmed or suspected to lie within 10 Mpc have been observed by HST sufficiently to resolve the brightest stars, build a color-magnitude diagram, and determine a distance from the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch.   It would take observations of 153 additional targets to have a complete sample of ALL suspected galaxies within 10 Mpc. The necessary information can be acquired at the rate of one orbit per candidate.  A complete sample would provide a valuable archival record of the vast majority of stars within 10 Mpc with M_I < -3.  There would be information on the stellar content of all manner of galaxies, in all manner of environments.  There would be robust constitution of groups.  There would be clear definition of local structure and flows.	A snap program will not in itself result in completion of such a sample but it gives a way forward toward the ultimate goal with minimal impact on HST resources.
Category: GALAXIES & CLUSTERS STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies are tiny galaxies that are dominated by intense, compact star-forming regions that contain thousands of massive OB and Wolf-Rayet stars. Thus, they present a different and extreme environment for star formation compared to the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies for the examination of the star formation process. The IMF of the massive stars in these enigmatic galaxies, in fact, is controversial. Global properties and models have been interpretted as showing considerable variation in the IMF with the metallicity of the system, while other studies argue that the IMF is fairly normal. We will resolve this issue by resolving one BCD into individual massive stars for the first time. The galaxy, IZW18, is renowned for its low abundances. We will use UVI-equivalent colors to construct color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions for the massive stars and F469N to identify evolved Wolf-Rayet stars. We will also examine the images in order to determine the numbers, physical sizes, and distributions of the star-forming regions. Halpha images will be used to examine the effect of the extreme concentration of massive stars on their environment.
