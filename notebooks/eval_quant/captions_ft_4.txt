Category: COSMOLOGY.  We have isolated a sample of 9 luminous {~2L*} galaxies with the very oldest stellar populations at their respective redshifts. The galaxies have been found in radio-source fields chosen to be at the key redshifts z~1.5 and z~2.5, which allow the cleanest separation of old stellar populations from highly reddened starbursts with colors derived from standard filter combinations. Ground-based observations in excellent seeing and with adaptive optics of 3 of these galaxies indicate that all 3 are dominated by well relaxed disks of old stars, suggesting that the first large stellar systems to form in the universe were disks in which star formation proceeded extremely rapidly and efficiently. In order to test this conjecture, we are requesting NICMOS2 exposures of our sample to obtain high S/N imaging in the F160W filter to determine detailed morphologies of the old stellar population, coupled with either NICMOS2 F110W or ACS F814W exposures {depending on redshift} to determine color gradients and/or other systematic color variations that might provide clues to formation processes.
Category: .  As the most massive objects in the universe, galaxy clusters represent important signposts in our story of structure evolution, and are the ultimate telescopic lenses, placing gravitationally lensed galaxies from the earliest epochs in comfortable reach for careful study. We take full advantage of the refurbished ACS and WFC3 cameras to deliver deep 14-filter images of 25 carefully chosen clusters. These will enable us to address timely and substantive questions about dark matter, dark energy, and galaxy evolution well beyond z=7. These X-ray clusters are chosen to be free of lensing bias and to span a wide range of redshift and mass. By combining strong and weak lensing, we will obtain the definitive mass profile of relaxed clusters to confront the distinctive prediction of the standard LambdaCDM model. Detailed maps of internal structure will be enabled by ~1,000 new multiply-imaged lensed sources to AB=26, all with precise {2% x {1+z}} photometric redshift measurements, thanks to WFC3's UV and IR coverage.  A supernovae search in parallel {with low magnification uncertainties} will extend the Hubble diagram of SN1a to z>1.5, testing the constancy of dark energy with time and probing progenitor evolution. Our homogeneous panchromatic deep imaging of this cluster sample will constitute a vast legacy archive for studies of the formation and evolution of structure.

Category: GALAXIES.  We propose to image the cD galaxy host of the most powerful radio outburst known in the Universe. The outburst was identified in a Chandra image of a z=0.216 galaxy cluster which revealed a pair of enormous cavities, each 200 kpc in diameter, embedded in its X-ray halo. The outburst began approximately 100 Myr ago and has expended 6x10^61 ergs. It is apparently powered by accretion onto the cD's billion solar mass nuclear black hole, which grew heavier by roughly 1/3 during the outburst. We intend to examine the morphology and nuclear environment of the host galaxy to understand the conditions that created this remarkable event.
Category: COSMOLOGY.  In spite of recent progress, the role of distant galaxies in cosmic reionization has been difficult to pin down. A powerful way to make progress is to move beyond counting high redshift sources and study the stellar properties of the population instead. Accurate knowledge of the average star formation density and its recent history in the universe at this epoch is necessary to determine whether these galaxies emit enough hard photons to reionize the Universe. SURFS UP is a Spitzer Exploration Science program (PI Bradac) designed to measure stellar masses and ages of galaxies at z >~ 7 and identify the dominant sources of the bulk of ionizing photons necessary to drive reionization. The last observations were completed in March 2014. The program uses 10 galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes to study galaxies at intrinsically lower luminosities than blank field surveys of the same exposure time. All clusters but one have both extremely deep HST and Spitzer data available. The last cluster (MACS2214) is lacking HST WFC3-IR data which are crucial to select galaxies at z >~ 7, to study their instantaneous star formation rate via rest-frame UV, and to study their evolved population via rest-frame optical. We request here 5 orbits of WFC3-IR data, which will be a crucial complement to the existing extremely deep Spitzer and HST-ACS data for MACS2214, as well as to the entire SURFS UP sample. The proposal will double the number of currently detected sub-L* galaxies at z>~7 that have been detected by Spitzer and for which we can measure stellar masses and ages. The request of 5 orbits will strongly increase the legacy value of SURFS UP and we waive any proprietary rights.
Category: COSMOLOGY.  The aim of these observations is to obtain deep z/ACS and H/NICMOS images in the core of two lensing clusters, A1835 and AC114, where a few z ~ 7-10 galaxy candidates have been selected from our ultra-deep JHK imaging program with Isaac/VLT. Spectroscopic observations have allowed to confirm 2 of these candidates thanks to the detection of faint emission lines identified as Lyman alpha at z=7.2 and 10. Our HST project is focused on two main goals: {1} the morphological confirmation of galaxy candidates lying near critical lines, and {2} the determination of the physical scales involved in star-forming regions at z ~ 7-10. These goals should have important implications on our present knowledge of the galaxy formation process in the early Universe.
Category: COSMOLOGY.  We propose the continuation of our highly successful ACS+WFC3 SNAPshot survey of a sample of 125 very X-ray luminous clusters in the redshift range 0.3-0.7, detected and compiled by the MACS cluster survey. As demonstrated by ACS/WFC3 SNAPshots of 63 MACS clusters obtained by us in previous Cycles {14 of them in all of F606W, F814W, F110W, and F140W}, dedicated HST observations of the 12 most distant MACS clusters {GO-09722}, and the CLASH MCT programme, these systems are highly efficient gravitational lenses as well as ideal targets for studies of galaxy evolution in dense environments.  Our primary science goals are a} the discovery of additional bright, giant arcs for resolved, in-depth, spectroscopic study with 8-10m telescopes, b} the selection of Distant Red Galaxies as well as z>6 galaxies as F814W dropouts, and c} the identification of extremely luminous but optically faint submm galaxies at z=2-5 detected in our Herschel/SPIRE observations of this sample. In addition, the proposed observations will d} provide important constraints on the mass distributions in these extreme systems, and e} improve our understanding of the physical nature of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-gas interactions in cluster cores.  In recognition of the particular value of WFC3 images for our primary science goals {so far, only 21 WFC3/SNAPs have been executed}, we stagger the proposed visits such that SNAPshots in the WFC3/F110W and F140W passbands will be executed first, followed by ACS observations in the F606W and F814W filters. The images thus obtained will build a dataset of legacy value for a wide range of extragalactic research topics.
