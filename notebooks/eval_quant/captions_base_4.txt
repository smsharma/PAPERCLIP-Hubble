Category: COSMOLOGY.  The high surface density {~ 200 arcmin^-2} of the faintest sources revealed via ultra-deep CCD images suggests we may have detected a population of high redshift pre-galactic halos. The abundance, clustering and other properties of such sources would be valuable constraints on theories of structure formation. To verify the hypothesis redshifts and hence luminosities are required for sources well beyond the spectroscopic limits of even 10-m class telescopes. By using the gravitational distortion induced by foreground rich clusters, we demonstrate that it is possible to secure reliable distances at these limits by analysing the images of background sources viewed through a highly-constrained cluster lens. From HST images of a single cluster, the redshift distribution of ~ 60 objects to R=25 has already been determined. A further development is the use of lensing to provide constraints on source counts and redshifts to yet fainter limits, R~29, by analysing the location and abundance of highly-magnified `pairs'. The combination of both techniques, made possible only with HST, provides the only avenue towards constraining a pre-galactic halo population. We propose to apply both techniques to a further cluster enabling us to 1} compare our lensing-derived N{z} at R<=23 with spectroscopic results, 2} extend the inversion depth to R=26, and 3} analyse the frequency and geometry of faint pairs to constrain the distance and abundance of sources to R~29.
Category: Galaxies.  Despite the success of galaxy formation models, some questions remain largely unanswered. Chief among these: (1) how did galaxies reionize the universe (if they did)? (2) How do they evolve? (3) How do gas and metals cycle in and out of galaxies? JWST will undoubtedly help us advance galaxy formation and evolution science. However, to answer these and many other questions,  deep rest-frame UV and optical data will still be required. Given JWST's limited lifetime, it is essential to obtain ancillary data crucial for its success. The JWST GTO program CANUCS (CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey) aims to answer these questions by observing five galaxy clusters and ten parallel fields for 200 hours with NIRISS grisms, NIRCam imager, and NIRSpec multi-object spectrograph. However, only in conjunction with the proposed deep,  high-resolution optical data will it determine: (1) Lyman-alpha observability of a sample of >1000 galaxies at z > 6 well into the reionization epoch. (2) Robustly determine star formation histories of >10,000 cosmic-noon galaxies. (3) Study metallicity gradients of >200 dwarf galaxies in a large and well-defined sample at cosmic noon. This proposal will deliver uniform and essential data using ACS F435W and F606W for the CANUCS clusters, perform a supernova search and explore extraordinary objects, including a galaxy similar to the host of supernova Refsdal and an intrinsically faint, low-mass confirmed z>7 source. This proposal will provide an extremely valuable data set for the whole community, and we waive any proprietary rights for this proposal.
Category: Galaxies.  Physical processes governing the formation/evolution of high-redshift galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR; z>6) are still not well understood.	In most cases, EoR galaxies are fuzzy faint blobs showing little internal structure, and fitting various theoretical models to spatially-integrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is often all that can be done.  There are, however, a small number of luminous EoR galaxies, such as Himiko at z=6.595 and CR7 at z=6.601, whose exceptional brightnesses have allowed spatially-resolved studies and have revealed some fascinating details.  Although such luminous EoR galaxies are rare, the Subary/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey has recently discovered 7 comparably bright EoR galaxies with y < 25 mag (in comparison, y=25.4 and 24.5 mag with Himiko and CR7, respectively). Here, we propose to obtain HST/WFC3 near-infrared images for these exceptionally luminous z>6 galaxies with the F105W, F125W, and F160W filters. Our goals are, (1) to identify the rest-frame UV continuum morphology, (2) to measure UV continuum spectral slopes, and (3) to compare the UV continuum morphology with those of Ly-alpha, [C II], and dust emission when possible. The obtained HST data will allow us to probe the internal structures and underlying physical processes in these remarkable high-redshift galaxies.  The targeted z>6 EoR galaxies are so bright that they will also make excellent targets for NIRSpec IFU observations, enabling us to study the internal structure and kinematics of these high-redshift galaxies in greater detail. The obtained HST data will also be essential to make effective us of precious JWST time.
Category: .  As the most massive objects in the universe, galaxy clusters represent important signposts in our story of structure evolution, and are the ultimate telescopic lenses, placing gravitationally lensed galaxies from the earliest epochs in comfortable reach for careful study. We take full advantage of the refurbished ACS and WFC3 cameras to deliver deep 14-filter images of 25 carefully chosen clusters. These will enable us to address timely and substantive questions about dark matter, dark energy, and galaxy evolution well beyond z=7. These X-ray clusters are chosen to be free of lensing bias and to span a wide range of redshift and mass. By combining strong and weak lensing, we will obtain the definitive mass profile of relaxed clusters to confront the distinctive prediction of the standard LambdaCDM model. Detailed maps of internal structure will be enabled by ~1,000 new multiply-imaged lensed sources to AB=26, all with precise {2% x {1+z}} photometric redshift measurements, thanks to WFC3's UV and IR coverage.  A supernovae search in parallel {with low magnification uncertainties} will extend the Hubble diagram of SN1a to z>1.5, testing the constancy of dark energy with time and probing progenitor evolution. Our homogeneous panchromatic deep imaging of this cluster sample will constitute a vast legacy archive for studies of the formation and evolution of structure.

Category: UNRESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS AND GALAXY STRUCTURE.  We propose to use WFC3 to perform a contiguous, high spatial resolution UV (F336W) and IR (F160W) survey of an area of ~100 square arcminutes in the core of the Coma cluster of galaxies. The area is already surveyed by our group in optical passbands with the ACS F475W and F814W filters. The new UV and IR data will be used, in combination with existing ACS data, for studies of the populations of Globular Clusters (GCs), Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies (UCDs), and Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) in Coma galaxies and in the cluster environment. Using an innovative technique developed by members of our team, we can essentially eliminate foreground and background contamination from samples of compact stellar systems. This allows us, for the first time, to perform the most detailed assessment and study of the very large population of Intracluster GCs in a nearby rich cluster (i.e. Coma), to find why this population is so abundant, and why it contains such a significant metal-rich component, which is unexpected if the origin is from stripping of clusters from low-mass dwarf galaxies. For NSCs, the additional passbands will allow us to test predictions of the relationship between NSC properties and age and metallicity gradients in the host galaxies, which in turn helps to understand the NSC formation mechanisms, and the timescale and feedback process that truncate the star formation. This is the last opportunity to perform a rest-frame UV survey at z=0, given the rapidly declining capability of WFC3/UVIS and the fact that there is no prospect for a future UV space mission for decades to come.
Category: Stellar Populations.  We propose to complete multi-wavelength broad- and narrow-band imaging, from the ultraviolet through the near-infrared, of a sample of 13 of the most extreme star-forming galaxies found in the nearby (D < 100 Mpc) universe. These include massive and dwarf, interacting and isolated, dusty and nearly dust-free galaxies.  The intense star formation in these galaxies can result in the formation of extremely massive young star clusters, in excess of a million solar masses, similar to the most massive known ancient globular clusters and 1-2 orders of magnitude more massive than any young cluster found in nearby quiescent/normal star-forming galaxies.  The properties of clusters and larger scale star-forming clumps in intense star-forming environments are required to address a number of outstanding issues, including whether the fraction of stars in bound clusters or the upper cutoff in cluster mass functions increases with star formation intensity, and how long the clumps survive.  Our results will differentiate between various assumptions and prescriptions for feedback used in the current generation of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.  The multi-wavelength observations will allow us to constrain dust geometry, and begin to peer through the dust to discover some of the	clusters obscured at UV and optical wavelengths, work that will be completed by JWST.  A similar suite of benchmark HST observations of normal, nearby galaxies already exists as part of the LEGUS project, and will be used as a reference to quantify the extreme star formation in our sample.
Category: COSMOLOGY.  An individual, highly magnified star close to a cluster caustic should provide a unique new window on the composition of dark matter. In late April 2016, we detected a brightening source (named "Icarus") near (<0.1 arcsec) the critical curve of the MACS J1149 galaxy cluster (z=0.54). Its unchanging spectral energy distribution (SED) matches that of a mid-to-late B-type star at the lensed background galaxy's redshift of z=1.49. Near peak brightness in May 2016, the individual star was likely magnified by the cluster by a factor of at least ~2000.  WFC3 imaging taken October 30 2016 after the field re-emerged from behind the sun has revealed an entirely unanticipated new source approximately 0.26 arcsec from Icarus.  Its F125W-F160W color is consistent with that of Icarus. If a counterimage, it could potentially have been "hidden" due to temporary demagnification by a massive object (>20 solar masses) in the intracluster medium.  However, this possibility only has a reasonable probability if massive black holes account for at least a modest fraction of dark matter, as has been hypothesized to explain the LIGO detection of merging 30 solar-mass black holes in September, 2015.  An alternate explanation is that the new image is of a different star with similar color undergoing an extreme microlensing event. If dark matter is an ultra-light scalar field, which would be granular (Hui et al. 2016), instead of a smoothly distributed WIMP, then the probability of a second event at the large offset from Icarus may be significantly larger.  A measurement of the SED of the new source will determine if it can be the counterimage of Icarus, or if it is instead a different star.
