Category: SOLAR SYSTEM.  We propose a systematic imaging and spectroscopicinvestigation of comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp). The comet willbe monitored over a wide range of heliocentric distances,providing unique information on the sublimation behavior ofthis unusual object. The images will be used to placesensitive constraints on the size of the nucleus, search forpossible companion nuclei, and examine the near-nucleus comamorphology for evidence of jets and shells. Spectroscopicexposures will allow us to place constraints on the source ofcometary activity at large heliocentric distance and detectthe onset of water sublimation.  If near-perihelionobservations are permitted, we will conduct deep searches fornew species at unprecedented sensitivity, compile an inventoryof the important C-, H-, N-, O-, and S-bearing species in thenucleus, measure the OD/OH ratio, and possibly even physicallyresolve the nucleus. If this comet achieves its expectedbrightness, the quality of the HST near-perihelion data willtruly be spectacular and will provide fundamental, newinsights into the nature of comets.
Category: SOLAR SYSTEM.  This is the continuation of GO 6621 {PI: M. A'Hearn} which received long-term {2-year} status in cycle 6 to observe the periodic comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, the parent of the Leonid meteor stream, whose forthcoming return provides a very rare opportunity to study the nucleus of a P/Halley class comet {P = 33 yr, aphelion = 20 AU} and the relationship of cometary ejection processes to a major meteor stream. The comet comes to perihelion in cycle 7 with an unusually close approach to Earth 40 days before, on 17 January 1998. At the geocentric distance of 0.45 AU, the Planetary Camera will achieve a spatial resolution {2 pixels} of 30 km allowing light from the nucleus to be clearly distinguished from light due to the surrounding coma. Understanding the expected meteor storm in the Leonid shower requires knowledge of the comet's nuclear properties. We plan to measure the B, V, R, I magnitudes of the nucleus in order to derive its color, and we plan to study its rotational properties by measuring its projected cross sections as a function of time. Concurent thermal infrared observations {ISOCAM, ground-based infrared camera} will allow to derive its albedo and in turn its size with very minimal asumptions. The HST images will also enable us to study the circum-nuclear region, in particular, the relationship of the nuclear outgassing and the physical properties of the dust {e.g., its color} to the nuclear rotation. We expect to image possible dust structures and to possibly map the sources of dust on the nucleus.

Category: SOLAR SYSTEM.  We propose to carry out high-resolution imaging of the near-nuclearregions of comet Hyakutake to determine the structure and evolution of theplasma.	These images will determine the nature of the comet's interactionwith the solar wind, show the morphology of the comet's magnetic field,provide insight to mechanisms for disconnection events (DE's), and assist indetermining the important mechanism for ionizing molecules in comets.  Theinteraction of the solar wind with comets -- capture of solar magnetic fieldlines, formation of the plasma tail, formation of rays, activity includingdisconnection events, ionization of molecules -- is widely believed tofollow a standard paradigm. None of the features of the paradigm have beenverified for nuclear distances less than about 1000 km or with spatialresolutions comparable to the expected dimension of fine structure.  Thisdimension is the Larmor radius of water ions; for this case, about 15 km.For a comet with a geocentric distance of 1 AU, each WFC-2 chip willcover about 55,000 km on a side, with a resolution of 72 km.	Such animage would provide, by far, the most stringent test of our physical viewof the comet/solar wind interaction.  These observations require a cometof total visual magnitude 10 or less, the preferred target being a newcomet of magnitude 7 or less.

Category: SOLAR SYSTEM INNER PLANETS.  We propose to use WF/PC-II to make high-resolution observations of the surface and atmosphere of Mars.  These observations will employ the new capabilities the WF/PC-II including the novel Linear Ramp Filters and improved FUV performance to place more stringent constraints on the atmospheric water, ozone, airborne dust, surface optical properties and iron mineralogy.  We propose to conduct these observations during mid February 1995, when Mars is near opposition.  The proposed observing period will overlap with the nominal mission of the Mars Observer spacecraft.  The WF/PC-II UV, VIS, and NIR capabilities will complement the planned observations by the Mars Observer Camera (MOC), the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR) and the Thermal emission Spectrometer (TES).
