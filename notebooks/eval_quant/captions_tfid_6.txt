Category: GALAXIES.  Resolving the nature of dark matter, at least some of which is baryonic, is an urgent problem. If baryonic dark matter is associated with luminous baryonic matter, MACHOs {massive compact objects} are the preferred candidate as inferred from gravitational microlensing of LMC stars. Given the uncertainties in the dynamical modeling of the dark components of the halo, a broad mass range for MACHO candidates merits consideration, from 0.01 M_sun to 1 M_sun. This includes the mass range of brown dwarfs and M dwarfs, whose contribution towards the dark mass is unknown. We propose to use HST to undertake a pixel microlensing study of M87 in order to: 1} probe the lower end of the M87 IMF via star-star lensing, 2} possibly obtain the first evidence of MACHOs in the halo of a galaxy other than our own, and 3} search for intracluster MACHOs. The program is challenging, but very feasible, with the HST. Over a period of 30 days and with half orbit exposures in each of two colors at a rate of one per day, we will observe approximately 1-2 events per day for a MACHO of mass 0.1 M_sun, with about 5 points of the lightcurve above 3 sigma. This provides a moderately high event significance threshold of S/N >= 10. The key factor that makes this project possible with the HST is the small pixel scale of the WFPC2, coupled with the small, stable PSF and superior photometric capabilities.
