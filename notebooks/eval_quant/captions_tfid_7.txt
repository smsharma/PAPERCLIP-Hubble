Category: GALAXIES.  We propose to constrain the origin of spiral galaxy halos by studying stellar populations near the tip of the red giant branch. This will be the first systematic study of this population in external galaxies and will quadruple the sample of normal spiral galaxies for which the halo metallicity distribution function is measured. This larger sample will permit us to study the relationship between the bulge, disk, and halo components and between halos and globular systems. Such correlations will in turn provide indications as to whether the halo, bulge, and globular cluster systems built up nearly simultaneously in the early universe or were accreted over time through different kinds of merging events.
