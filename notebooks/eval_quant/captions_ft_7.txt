Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  We propose to exploit the resolution of the WFPC2 to obtain U, V, R, and I and narrow band H Alpha and O III images of an optimally-selected sample of three local dwarf starburst galaxies in order to understand the mechanism of star formation in these systems. These objects have O III equivalent widths greater than 50Angstrom. These dwarf galaxies are close enough that massive stars can be resolved by HST and are extremely important local laboratories for the study of star formation. This type of low luminosity irregular galaxy has been shown to evolve significantly from redshifts of 0.5 - 1 to the current epoch {Glazebrook et al. 1995, Driver et al. 1995, Lilly et al. 1995} in contrast to the more luminous population of early type systems that do not seem to evolve. The understanding of the evolutionary processes in these systems is unclear but interactions, merging, and general starburst activity seem to play a major role. Our detailed study of the sample proposed here may be of significant help in understanding the physics of these objects and there evolution. Many fundamental questions about the essential physical nature of these and larger starburst systems remain unanswered including: {1} is the mass function of a burst restricted to the high mass end; {2} does it depend on metallicity; {3} what physical mechanisms actually trigger the burst. Our HST data will have sufficient spatial resolution to resolve isolated individual high mass main sequence stars and super giants and to distinguish clusters similar to R136A.
Category: GALAXIES.  We propose WFPC2 imaging of two interacting galaxy pairs in two bandpasses {B and I}. In the two-dimensional space of interactions that go from weak to strong, and from early to late, these 2 pairs represent the as-yet unstudied cases of ``late weak'' and ``early strong'' interactions. Our goal is primarily to determine whether the super star clusters {SSC's} that are so prevalent in strong, evolved interactions have also been able to form in the weak or young interactions. Secondly, if such clusters are found, we hope to correlate their properties as much as possible to the strengths and ages of the interactions, using the results of previous HST studies {by other authors} of SSC's in older, stronger interactions to complete the correlation space study. We wish to derive the luminosity function, color distribution, and spatial distribution of these clusters, with the hope of correlating those properties with {a} the distribution and site-specific properties of H II regions that are already seen in ground- based H-alpha observations and with {b} the global physical parameters of the tidal interaction event. In this way, we hope to understand further what are the conditions under which such massive star clusters form, what is their prevalence at the present epoch in violently star-forming regions, and are these regions likely analogs for early epochs of star and galaxy formation.
Category: GALAXIES.  Rings of star formation are a common phenomenon of early-type spiral galaxies. Most rings form by gas cloud collisions near resonances, under the continuous action of gravity torques from a bar perturbation, while a small number form in response to a mild tidal interaction with a nearby companion. In either case, a resonance is a very special place in any galaxy where star formation can be enhanced and may proceed either as a starburst or continuously over a long time period. Resonance rings are natural dynamical laboratories for star cluster formation and evolution. We are proposing here to study star formation in two galaxies where we feel certain that the rings are resonance rings with a different origin. NGC 3081 has four excellent star-forming rings that are easily connected to bar- driven gas dynamics, while NGC 4622 is a nonbarred spiral where a strong inner ring is easily connected to a tidal interaction. We wish to isolate the young clusters in the rings of these two galaxies, measure their ages and luminosity functions, examine the properties of the background starlight, and use the information to trace the dynamics of these galaxies and understand the interplay between perturbations, gas dynamics, and star formation in normal galaxies.

Category: GALAXIES.  We propose to constrain the origin of spiral galaxy halos by studying stellar populations near the tip of the red giant branch. This will be the first systematic study of this population in external galaxies and will quadruple the sample of normal spiral galaxies for which the halo metallicity distribution function is measured. This larger sample will permit us to study the relationship between the bulge, disk, and halo components and between halos and globular systems. Such correlations will in turn provide indications as to whether the halo, bulge, and globular cluster systems built up nearly simultaneously in the early universe or were accreted over time through different kinds of merging events.

Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  The M81 group is one of the nearest groups of galaxies to ourown but its properties are quite different from that of theLocal Group.  It has therefore provided a differentevolutionary environment for its member galaxies. This teamhas carried out a CCD survey of the M81 group to search foranalogs to the Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies.We have recovered all of the M81 dwarf candidates previouslyidentified in photographic surveys and, in addition, havediscovered six new systems whose surface brightnesses andapparent sizes place them within the range of values found forthe Local Group dSphs.  In this proposal we request HST timeto image two of the candidate M81 group dSph systems. Theproposed observations will allow construction of color-magnitude diagrams covering the upper two magnitudes of thered giant branch and will allow a determination of theirdistance (via the luminosity of the giant branch tip), anestimate of their mean abundance (via the mean giant branchcolor) and a first estimate of their star formation history(via the frequency of occurrence of upper-AGB stars).Comparison of these results with those for the Local GroupdSphs will then help define the dependence of the formationand evolution of these low luminosity galaxies on the localconditions.

The recent detection of H_2O masers in an edge-on diskorbiting a massive black hole in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC4258 (Miyoshi et al. 1995) represents a fundamental stepforward in our understanding of the structure of activegalactic nuclei.	Ground-based imaging- and spectro-polarimetry obtained by us during the past year have extendedthis result with the discovery of a featureless nuclearcontinuum and 1000 km s^-1-wide emission lines, polarizedpresumably by scattering in a toroidal geometry.  Thepolarization position angle is identical to the elongation ofthe maser disk on the sky, establishing a direct link betweenthe geometry of an obscuring torus in an active galaxy andmaterial orbiting a compact object of high mass.  We proposeto obtain small-aperture UV spectroscopy andspectropolarimetry of the nucleus of NGC 4258 to isolate thisscattered AGN spectrum from the surrounding starlight.  Thiswill be used to measure the nonthermal spectral shape andluminosity, and search for scattered UV emission lines.  Inaddition, ultraviolet images obtained with WFPC2 will becompared with existing Cycle 4 optical continuum and emission-line images to search for the ionizing cones which areexpected to be produced by radiation escaping along the axisof the torus.	Unfortunately, high-resolution imagingpolarimetry must await the installation of the Advanced Camerain 1999.
