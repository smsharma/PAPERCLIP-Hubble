Category: QUASAR ABSORPTION LINES AND IGM.  We propose to conduct a spectroscopic survey of Lyman limit absorbers at redshifts 1.8 < z < 2.5, using WFC3 and the G280 grism.  This proposal intends to complete an approved Cycle 15 SNAP program {#10878} which was cut short due to the ACS failure.  We have selected 64 quasars at 2.3 < z < 2.6 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Spectroscopic Quasar sample, for which no BAL signature is found at the QSO redshift and no strong metal absorption lines are present at z > 2.3 along the lines of sight.  The survey has three main observational goals.  First, we will determine the redshift frequency dn/dz of the LLS over the column density range 16.0 < log{NHI} < 20.3 cm^-2.  Second, we will measure the column density frequency distribution f{N} for the partial Lyman limit systems {PLLS} over the column density range 16.0 < log{NHI} < 17.5 cm^-2.  Third, we will identify those sightlines which could provide a measurement of the primordial D/H ratio.  By carrying out this survey, we can also help place meaningful constraints on two key quantities of cosmological relevance.  First, we will estimate the amount of metals in the LLS using the f{N}, and ground based observations of metal line transitions.	Second, by determining f{N} of the PLLS, we can constrain the amplitude of the ionizing UV background at z~2 to a greater precision.  This survey is ideal for a snapshot observing program, because the on-object integration times are all well below 30 minutes, and follow-up observations from the ground require minimal telescope time due to the QSO sample being bright.

Category: None.  Star forming regions contain many resolved structures, ranging from disks around individual stars to narrow and wide binaries to large-scale outflows, bubbles and shock fronts traversing the entire cloud. In many cases, optical high-resolution imaging is the best tool to find and study these objects. We propose a pure-parallel survey, where no primary orbits are allocated and instead or observations are performed on whatever happens to be in the field-of-view of the WFC3 or ACS when other programs use STIS or COS on targets in star forming regions. In this way, we can survey a large area to discover (i) previously unresolved companions, (ii) jets and outflows from young stars and (iii) irradiated and evaporating disks. Typically, such imaging studies are done in the most "interesting" regions close to the most massive and brightest stars. Our survey can complement that by imaging more "typical" parts of the cloud. We will use a combination of broad-band filters to detect nebulosity and identify and separate point sources as well as narrow-band filters in emission lines typically seen from irradiated disks, jets, and outflows.

Category: GALAXIES.  Because Lyman-alpha photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen, the strength and spatial extent of Lya emission in galaxies depend on the HI column density and covering fraction, properties that are of primary interest to the escape of ionizing radiation. Lya emission is particularly important to the study of low mass, low metallicity galaxies: such objects are likely to be responsible for the reionization of the universe, and Lya emission is more common in these galaxies. With this proposal, we request 7 orbits of WFC3/UVIS imaging to obtain a high resolution map of Lya emission in the low mass, low metallicity z=1.85 gravitationally lensed galaxy SL2SJ021737-051329. With oxygen abundance <10% of solar, stellar mass <10^8 Msun, and extremely strong Lya emission with rest-frame equivalent width ~120 A, this object is a prime example of a low mass Lya-emitter, and its gravitational magnification by a factor of ~35 results in remarkably high WFC3/UVIS spatial resolution of ~20 pc. Existing HST broadband and IR grism observations will allow us to compare the spatial extent of the Lya emission with both the rest-frame UV continuum and the rest-frame optical nebular line emission, in order to map the resonant scattering of Lya photons from their origin in star-forming regions, obtain constraints on the location of the scattering gas, and relate this information to the kinematics and geometry of the galaxy. The proposed observations, in combination with the spectroscopic information we have already obtained, will provide the most comprehensive and highest resolution picture of Lya emission at z > 1 to date.
Category: .  As the most massive objects in the universe, galaxy clusters represent important signposts in our story of structure evolution, and are the ultimate telescopic lenses, placing gravitationally lensed galaxies from the earliest epochs in comfortable reach for careful study. We take full advantage of the refurbished ACS and WFC3 cameras to deliver deep 14-filter images of 25 carefully chosen clusters. These will enable us to address timely and substantive questions about dark matter, dark energy, and galaxy evolution well beyond z=7. These X-ray clusters are chosen to be free of lensing bias and to span a wide range of redshift and mass. By combining strong and weak lensing, we will obtain the definitive mass profile of relaxed clusters to confront the distinctive prediction of the standard LambdaCDM model. Detailed maps of internal structure will be enabled by ~1,000 new multiply-imaged lensed sources to AB=26, all with precise {2% x {1+z}} photometric redshift measurements, thanks to WFC3's UV and IR coverage.  A supernovae search in parallel {with low magnification uncertainties} will extend the Hubble diagram of SN1a to z>1.5, testing the constancy of dark energy with time and probing progenitor evolution. Our homogeneous panchromatic deep imaging of this cluster sample will constitute a vast legacy archive for studies of the formation and evolution of structure.
