Category: QUASAR ABSORPTION LINES AND IGM.  We propose very deep intermediate-band Lyman alpha imaging in the field of a newly-discovered proto-cluster region surrounding the extremely luminous QSO HS1549+19 at z=2.844. The large structure, initially discovered in a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in fields surrounding the brightest QSOs at z=2.5-2.8, represents an ideal laboratory for studying the response of the intergalactic medium to a source of ionizing photons that exceeds the UV background by factors >1000.  Within a single pointing of WFC3-UVIS there are already more than 45 known Lyman alpha emitters, most of which are already spectroscopically confirmed, and at least 3 of which are giant ``Lyman alpha blobs''.  Many of the objects have properties similar to those expected from the process of fluorescence, in which Lyman alpha emission is induced by the UV radiation field of the QSO in any HI gas that dense enough to remain partially self-shielded.  Fortuitously, the F467M filter {Stromgren "b"} in WFC3-UVIS is a perfect match to Lyman alpha at z=2.844. In combination with an equally deep broad-band continuum image, the observations will allow the construction of a Lyman alpha map tracing dense gas throughout the inner parts of a proto-cluster region at sub-kpc resolution. The ability to measure the spatial sub-structure and surface brightness distribution of Lya emission, relative to known protocluster galaxies and AGN, will illuminate the ``cosmic web'' in a dense region caught in a violent stage of formation.

Category: IGM AND COS.  We seek to determine whether SDSSCGB-46589.1 may be a Lyman alpha blob at a redshift of z = 0.273 or an extended UV disk galaxy.  Lyman alpha blobs are typically found in abundance at redshift around 2 - 3, in strongly clustered environments.  They are curious markers of large scale structure, devoid of continuum emission, with luminoities L(Lya) ~ 1e44 erg/s, and linear dimensions ~ 100 kpc. The exact mechanism(s) for excitation have not been conclusively identified, but several have been proposed, including excitation from cold accretion streams, resonance scattering from nearby sources, supernovae or stellar driven outflows, etc.  They are anticipated to be rare at low redshift, with the nearest one ever found residing at z =1. If confirmed by the observations proposed here, then this would be the lowest redshift Lyman alpha blob ever found. It would then offer the opportunity to fully examine its location within the cluster environment, wherein high spatial and spectral resolution observations could be brought-to-bear, with the ultimate goal of determining the excitation mechanism for these enigmatic objects.  Our preliminary goal for this proposal is to search for embedded continuum emitting sources, and to confirm or deny the Lyman alpha blob or extended UV disk nature of this object through the use of far-UV imaging and slitless spectroscopy.
