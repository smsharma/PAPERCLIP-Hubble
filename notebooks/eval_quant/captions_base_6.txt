Category: Galaxies & Clusters.  We propose to obtain a map of the mass, including the dark matter, in the core of the richest galaxy cluster, Abell 1689 at z=0.18. The only way to do this is to take very deep images of the cluster and measure the gravitational lens distortion of the blue background galaxy population. The confirmation of distortions in the lensed background galaxies inferred from very deep ground-based observations will allow us to produce a high quality map of the cluster mass distribution over a range of scales from 10 kpc to 1 Mpc, revealing the nature of the non-singular mass core. The detailed shape of this mass core inside 100 kpc will contain information on the nature of the dark matter and the scenario for sub-structure formation in clusters of galaxies. Background galaxies in the range B=24-- 26 are very compact {r<0.5 arcsec} and, in order to constrain lens models, it is essential to measure both the width and the length of the distorted galaxies---accurate width measurement is virtually impossible with ground-based resolution.
Category: COSMOLOGY.  The high surface density {~ 200 arcmin^-2} of the faintest sources revealed via ultra-deep CCD images suggests we may have detected a population of high redshift pre-galactic halos. The abundance, clustering and other properties of such sources would be valuable constraints on theories of structure formation. To verify the hypothesis redshifts and hence luminosities are required for sources well beyond the spectroscopic limits of even 10-m class telescopes. By using the gravitational distortion induced by foreground rich clusters, we demonstrate that it is possible to secure reliable distances at these limits by analysing the images of background sources viewed through a highly-constrained cluster lens. From HST images of a single cluster, the redshift distribution of ~ 60 objects to R=25 has already been determined. A further development is the use of lensing to provide constraints on source counts and redshifts to yet fainter limits, R~29, by analysing the location and abundance of highly-magnified `pairs'. The combination of both techniques, made possible only with HST, provides the only avenue towards constraining a pre-galactic halo population. We propose to apply both techniques to a further cluster enabling us to 1} compare our lensing-derived N{z} at R<=23 with spectroscopic results, 2} extend the inversion depth to R=26, and 3} analyse the frequency and geometry of faint pairs to constrain the distance and abundance of sources to R~29.
Category: GALAXIES & CLUSTERS.  The shear of faint galaxy images arising from gravitationallensing by foreground massive clusters provides importantconstraints on the distribution and total amount of mass inthe clusters. Furthermore, in a few rare clusters, the lensingmodels may be sufficiently well-constrained by arcs andmultiple images to yield robust redshift estimates for faintgalaxies well beyond reach of current spectrographs.  Ground-based telescopes suffer systematic degradations which reducethe detected shear by factors of ~2-3.  Detecting theunadulterated shear pattern with HST will yield an  absolutecalibration of ground-based results and confirm or otherwisethe high cluster mass/light ratios obtained so far. We proposedeep WFPC-2 imaging of two of the most well-studied clustersfor this purpose. Both have the rare distinction of havinglensed features of known redshift which strongly constrain theabsolute mass. When calibrated with the HST shear, not onlywill more reliable mass maps result, but the lensing equationscan be inverted to provide statistical distances for largenumbers of very faint field galaxies. These will be invaluablein studies of galaxy evolution and for subsequent lensingapplications in other clusters.
Category: Galaxies and the IGM.  Despite a dramatic build-up in the number of quenched galaxies at z < 2, it is still entirely unclear how this quenching comes about. Potential quenching mechanisms fall into two categories: processes that act on "centrals" and those that act on "satellites". While both hydrodynamic and semi-analytic models do a good job of predicting the quenched fraction of centrals, they overpredict the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies, reflecting our much greater uncertainty about how "environmental" quenching occurs. Our 55-night Gemini Observatory "Large and Long Program" GOGREEN survey is obtaining optical spectroscopy for an unprecedentedly large sample of > 1000 members of 12 Coma- and Virgo-mass progenitor clusters at 1 < z < 1.5 (and > 600 field galaxies). Here, we propose for WFC3/F160W imaging of the GOGREEN sample to 1) measure the relative timing of star-formation quenching and morphological transformation, 2) make the first high-z measurement of satellite quenching by controlling for intrinsic quenching, and 3) constrain the dominant driver of size growth in the early-type population. Our team has the modeling framework to interpret the trends and to place unrivaled constraints on the physical processes that underlie environmental quenching and morphological transformation from late- to early-type galaxies. Because of Gemini Observatory's huge investment in the GOGREEN program, this survey will return the premier high-redshift cluster spectroscopic dataset for the foreseeable future. All reduced images, spectra and catalogs will be made publicly available, including catalogs from the F160W observations proposed here.

Category: Galaxies and the IGM.  Hubble's WFC3 has been a game changer for the study of early galaxy formation in the first 700 Myr after the Big Bang. Reliable samples of sources to redshift z~11, which can be discovered only from space, are now constraining the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function into the epoch of reionization. Unexpectedly but excitingly, the recent spectroscopic confirmations of L>L* galaxies at z>8.5 demonstrate that objects brighter than our own Galaxy are already present 500 Myr after the Big Bang, creating a challenge to current theoretical/numerical models that struggle to explain how galaxies can grow so luminous so quickly. Yet, the existing HST observations do not cover sufficient area, nor sample a large enough diversity of environments to provide an unbiased sample of sources, especially at z~9-11 where only a handful of bright candidates are known. To double this currently insufficient sample size, to constrain effectively the bright-end of the galaxy luminosity function at z~9-10, and to provide targets for follow-up imaging and spectroscopy with JWST, we propose a large-area pure-parallel survey that will discover the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG[4JWST]). We will observe ~580 arcmin^2 over 125 sightlines in five WFC3 bands (0.35 to 1.7 micron) using high-quality pure-parallel opportunities available in the cycle (3 orbits or longer). These public observations will identify more than 80 intrinsically bright galaxies at z~8-11, investigate the connection between halo mass, star formation and feedback in progenitors of groups and clusters, and build HST lasting legacy of large-area, near-IR imaging.

Category: .  How did the first massive galaxies in the universe form? Theoretical models predict that these form through mergers of gas-rich galaxies at very high-redshifts. These models are often invoked to explain the existence of massive 'red and dead' galaxies by z~2. We have unexpectedly identified a sample of six z>6 QSOs with close, gas-rich companions at the same redshifts through our on-going ALMA survey of [CII] and dust emission in QSO host galaxies. This is the first unambiguous direct observational evidence of gravitational interactions within the first Gyr of the universe, supporting the aforementioned theoretical models. These newly discovered QSO-galaxy pairs are a unique sample to demonstrate key capabilities of JWST in early science, such as the multi-object and IFU modes of NIRSpec.  Remarkably, three of these systems are separated by less than 10 kpc (<2 arcsec), which makes them prime targets to exploit the unparalleled IFU capabilities of JWST/NIRSpec in early science. Such observations will allow us to map the morphology and kinematics of these gravitational interactions as function of separation from the QSOs, which will enlighten our understanding of early black hole and galaxy growth. Thus, it is of critical importance to characterize the rest-frame UV/optical properties of these companions before the JWST launch. Here we propose deep WFC3/IR F140W observations to set the first firm constraints on their rest-frame UV properties, which can only be achieved by the sensitivity and resolution of HST. These timely HST observations will be essential to enable a plethora of JWST early science programs.
Category: Galaxies.  Despite the success of galaxy formation models, some questions remain largely unanswered. Chief among these: (1) how did galaxies reionize the universe (if they did)? (2) How do they evolve? (3) How do gas and metals cycle in and out of galaxies? JWST will undoubtedly help us advance galaxy formation and evolution science. However, to answer these and many other questions,  deep rest-frame UV and optical data will still be required. Given JWST's limited lifetime, it is essential to obtain ancillary data crucial for its success. The JWST GTO program CANUCS (CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey) aims to answer these questions by observing five galaxy clusters and ten parallel fields for 200 hours with NIRISS grisms, NIRCam imager, and NIRSpec multi-object spectrograph. However, only in conjunction with the proposed deep,  high-resolution optical data will it determine: (1) Lyman-alpha observability of a sample of >1000 galaxies at z > 6 well into the reionization epoch. (2) Robustly determine star formation histories of >10,000 cosmic-noon galaxies. (3) Study metallicity gradients of >200 dwarf galaxies in a large and well-defined sample at cosmic noon. This proposal will deliver uniform and essential data using ACS F435W and F606W for the CANUCS clusters, perform a supernova search and explore extraordinary objects, including a galaxy similar to the host of supernova Refsdal and an intrinsically faint, low-mass confirmed z>7 source. This proposal will provide an extremely valuable data set for the whole community, and we waive any proprietary rights for this proposal.
