Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  The age, chemical and kinematic distributions of stellar populations provide powerful constraints on models of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. The globular clusters constitute an especially useful case because the stars within individual clusters are coeval and spatially distinct. But a serious limitation in the study of many globular clusters -- especially those located near the Galactic Center -- has been the existence of large absolute and differential extinction by foreground dust. We propose to use the ACS to map the differential extinction and remove their effects in a large sample of globular clusters located in the direction of the inner Galaxy using a technique refined recently by von Braun and Mateo {2001}. These observations and their analyses will let us produce high quality color-magnitude diagrams of these poorly studied clusters that will allow us to determine these clusters' relative ages, distances and chemistry and to address important questions about the formation and the evolution of the inner Galaxy. Our aim for these ACS observations is to obtain data for the most crowded clusters in the inner Galaxy where the excellent spatial resolution of the ACS is most necessary.

Category: GALAXIES & CLUSTERS.  We are proposing to obtain morphological information on galaxies in two of the highest redshift clusters known at present. The environments of 3C265 (z=0.811) and 3C184 (z=0.996) have been shown by us to contain rich clusters: deep imaging and spectroscopy from the ground show an excess of galaxies, several of them subsequently identified at the same redshift as the radio-galaxy in spectroscopy. The morphological state of galaxies in high redshift clusters should give us important clues about	the formation and evolution of galaxies in dense environments and the formation of clusters. The role played by mergers into the observed raise in the blue active fraction of galaxies with redshift (the Butcher-Oemler effect), the location of star forming regions, and the shape of "normal" elliptical and spiral galaxies, and their differences with galaxies in present day clusters, can be ideally assessed from HST imaging with WFPC2. Only a handful of clusters are known at z>0.8, these observations are expected to bring unique clues on the evolution of galaxies in clusters when the universe was 40% of its present age.

Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  We propose to make observations that directly test the proposition that globular clusters contain massive black holes. Our targets are the bulge globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. These are probably among the most massive  in the galaxy, but are understudied compared to more familiar objects such as M15. Our analysis suggests that these two clusters are the most likely to show unambiguous evidence for a central massive black hole if such things exist in globular clusters. The observations proposed will give us the first thorough kinematic and photometric studies of these two clusters. The combination of the two epochs will give us proper motions good to of order 6 km/s. In addition, they will provide us with the first good, deep, color-magnitude diagrams for these clusters. These diagrams will be used to investigate the make up of the stellar population in the clusters, to more firmly establish their distances, ages, and metallicities, and to search for a binary sequence.
