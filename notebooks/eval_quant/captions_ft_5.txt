Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  We propose to observe one of the most metal-rich globular cluster ever found, G177, recently identified in M31. We wish to take deep images in V and I bands, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution and red sensitivity of the Planetary Camera of WFPC2/HST, in order to build their colour-magnitude diagrams.  With respect to the outstanding properties of G177, we will address the questions of its metallicity, both in absolute scale, by confrontation with theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks, and in  relative scale, by comparison with coeval observations of two other clusters, G1 and G170, used as standards.  The data we propose to obtain would provide essential input for theories of stellar evolution, star formation history, and models of star cluster and galaxy formation.
Category: GALAXIES.  We propose to constrain the origin of spiral galaxy halos by studying stellar populations near the tip of the red giant branch. This will be the first systematic study of this population in external galaxies and will quadruple the sample of normal spiral galaxies for which the halo metallicity distribution function is measured. This larger sample will permit us to study the relationship between the bulge, disk, and halo components and between halos and globular systems. Such correlations will in turn provide indications as to whether the halo, bulge, and globular cluster systems built up nearly simultaneously in the early universe or were accreted over time through different kinds of merging events.
Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Our recent deep HST photometry of the M31 halo globular cluster {GC} Mayall~II, also called G1, has revealed a red-giant branch with a clear spread that we attribute to an intrinsic metallicity dispersion of at least 0.4 dex in [Fe/H]. The only other GC exhibiting such a metallicity dispersion is Omega Centauri, the brightest and most massive Galactic GC, whose range in [Fe/H] is about 0.5 dex. These observations are obviously linked to the fact that both G1 and Omega Cen are bright and massive GC, with potential wells deep enough to keep part of their gas, which might have been recycled, producing a metallicity scatter among cluster stars. These observations dramatically challenge the notion of chemical homogeneity as a defining characteristic of GCs. It is critically important to find out how common this phenomenon is and how it can constrain scenarios/models of GC formation. The obvious targets are other bright and massive GCs, which exist in M31 but not in our Galaxy where Omega Cen is an isolated giant. We propose to acquire, with ACS/HRC, deep imaging of 3 of the brightest M31 GCs for which we have observed velocity dispersion values similar to those observed in G1 and Omega Cen. A sample of GCs with chemical abundance dispersions will provide essential information about their formation mechanism. This would represent a major step for the studies of the origin and evolution of stellar populations.

Category: UNRESOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS AND GALAXY STRUCTUR.  The Spitzer Legacy project SINGS provided a unique view of the current state of star formation and dust in a sample of galaxies of all Hubble types. This multi-wavelength view allowed the team to create current star formation diagnostics that are independent of the dust content and increased our understanding of the dust in galaxies. Even so, using the SINGS data alone we can only make rough estimates of the recent star formation history of these galaxies. The lack of U-band observations means that it is impossible to estimate the ages of young clusters. In addition, the low resolution of the Spitzer and ground-based observations means that what appear to be individual Spitzer sources can actually be composed of many individual clusters with varying ages. In this proposal we plan to address this missing area in SINGS by obtaining high-resolution WFPC2 UBVI observations to accurately find and determine the ages of the young stellar clusters in a subset of the SINGS galaxies. These observations will greatly enhance the legacy value of the SINGS observations while also directly answering questions pertaining to star formation in galaxies.

Category: .  We propose to a program of Chandra and HST observations to test the recent suggestion that the bright X-ray source in Holmberg II is surrounded by a photoionization nebula powered by a central object with a luminosity of order 10^40 erg/s.
Category: Galaxies & Clusters.  The parallel program described here provides a random sample of galaxies in a large number of high latitude fields. Galactic star counts and the structure of the galactic halo will also be studied. The proposed exposures utilize the WFPC2 in parallel mode when another instrument is prime at high galactic latitude. The expectation is that these fields will represent a fair sample of the universe and the Galactic halo. This is a continuation of proposal 4849 into cycle 4. It is more or less identical except cycle 4 => cycle 5.

Category: STELLAR POPULATIONS.  Most planetary nebulae (PNe) are field objects. Precious little is known about their progenitor stars' properties and how they relate to those of the PN. The lone exceptions are the very rare cases where a PN is a member of an open star cluster. Then one can determine the ages, masses, and compositions of the progenitors, providing direct tests of stellar-evolution theory.  We have recently discovered three PNe belonging to open clusters in M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. Here we propose a set of HST follow-up investigations.  For the PN in the M31 cluster B477-D075, we know its precise location, and there are excellent photometric data (from the M31 PHAT project) that establish the host cluster's age (350 Myr) and the mass of the PN progenitor star (3.35 Msun). We will use STIS spectroscopy in the UV and optical to measure He, CNO, and alpha-process abundances in the nebula, based on emission-line fluxes and a photoionization code. Our primary aim is to compare the measured abundances with predictions of post-AGB evolution theory. In particular, "hot-bottom burning" is expected to produce enhanced He/H and N/O abundances when the progenitor star is sufficiently massive, but it is uncertain whether this occurs at masses as low as ~3 Msun, or requires masses of at least ~5 Msun. Thus our observations will provide key new constraints on AGB evolution of intermediate-mass stars.  For two other M31 clusters, B458-D049 and SK044A, whose integrated-light spectra show that a PN is present, we will use WFC3 with an [O III] filter to verify the presence of the PNe, and determine their precise astrometric locations. We will then follow up with STIS spectroscopy in a future HST Cycle.
