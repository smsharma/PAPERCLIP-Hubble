Category: ISM AND CIRCUMSTELLAR MATTER.  SAINTS is a program to observe SN 1987A, the brightest supernova since 1604, as it matures into the youngest supernova remnant at age 21. HST is the essential tool for resolving SN1987A's many physical components.  A violent encounter is underway between the fastest-moving debris and the circumstellar ring: shocks excite "hotspots." Radio, optical, infrared and X-ray fluxes have been rising rapidly: we have organized Australia Telescope, HST, VLT, Spitzer, and Chandra observations to understand the several emission mechanisms at work. Photons from the shocked ring will excite previously invisible gas outside the ring, revealing the true extent of the mass loss that preceded the explosion of Sanduleak -69 202.  This will help test ideas for the progenitor of SN 1987A. The inner debris, excited by radioactive isotopes from the explosion, is now resolved and seen to be aspherical, providing direct evidence on the shape of the explosion itself.  Questions about SN 1987A remain unanswered.  A rich and unbroken data set from SAINTS will help answer these central questions and will build an archive for the future to help answer questions we have not yet thought to ask.
Category: STELLAR PHYSICS.  This programme will provide a 30 year legacy point for SN 1987A, the brightest supernova since 1604. HST is the essential tool for resolving and analysing SN 1987A's several physical components. The inner, asymmetric ejecta are being heated by X-rays from the circumstellar ring and allow us to directly observe the geometry of the explosion. At the same time the fastest-moving ejecta are interacting with the ring, giving rise to bright emission from shocks. Our latest observations show that the ring is fading and that new spots are appearing outside, signalling that the blast wave has passed the ring and is now interacting with previously unseen material. It is also the beginning of the end for the ring. Here we propose to use COS and STIS to obtain a complete UV/optical spectrum of the ejecta and ring. The spectrum will enable a detailed modelling of the nucleosynthesis, which is a powerful diagnostic of the explosion, and provide a unique opportunity to study a supernova spectrum in the transition phase between a radioactively powered supernova and a shock heated remnant. It will also allow us to distinguish between different excitation mechanisms for the molecular hydrogen, recently discovered in the NIR. We also propose a set of broad and narrow band images to monitor the evolution of the flux and morphology of ejecta, ring and new spots outside the ring. The latter will tell us about the mass-loss history of the progenitor. The proposed observations will provide a crucial complement to recent Herschel and ALMA observations of dust, CO and SiO in the ejecta.

Category: ISM AND CIRCUMSTELLAR MATTER.  SN 1987A is the great supernova of the HST era.  It is the only case where we have detailed knowledge of the pre-existing structure in the circumstellar gas.  It is the only case where we can observe the details of a transition from supernova to supernova remnant. An unbroken string of observations is the essential tool for detecting change and establishing a uniform legacy archive.  As we have demonstrated, images reveal a wide variety of processes at work-- most notably the change in the energetics of the debris from radioactive power in the first 5000 days to X-ray illumination from the outside at the present day.  We also observed the explosive eruption of "hotspots" around the circumstellar ring and are now using their time history to infer their structure.  We have devised a way to image the reverse shock at both Lyman alpha and H-alpha that will help solve a riddle in the excitation of these lines and illuminate the hydrodynamics of the site where non-thermal processes are at work.  We propose this novel UV work for the current cycle.  The HST observations have a unique blend of photometric fidelity and angular resolution that also makes them the indispensable partner to ongoing X-ray, radio, and far-IR observations.	ALMA provides a new way to study dust formation and the kinematics of the explosion by comparison to HST images.	This HST program is a long term study: for a 25 year old remnant, we believe brief and simple annual sampling is adequate, but an ongoing commitment is essential.
Category: INTERSTELLAR AND INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM.  SAINTS is a program to observe SN 1987A, the brightest supernova in 384 years, as it morphs into the youngest supernova remnant at age 18. HST is the unique and perfect tool for spatially-resolved observations of the many physical components of SN 1987A. A violent encounter is underway between the fastest-moving debris and the circumstellar ring, exciting hotspots seen with HST that are suddenly lighting up. The optical and X-ray flux from the ring are both rising rapidly: HST and Chandra observations taken together are needed to understand the physics of these shocked regions. In Cycle14, the hotspots may fuse as the shock fully enters the ring. Photons from these shocks may excite previously hidden gas outside the ring, revealing the true extent of the mass loss that preceded the explosion. The inner debris of the explosion itself, still excited by radioactive isotopes produced in the explosion, is now well resolved by ACS and seen to be aspherical, providing direct clues to the mechanism of the explosion. Our search for a compact remnant is beginning to eliminate some theoretical possibilities and we have the opportunity in Cycle 14 to place much more stringent limits with NICMOS. Many questions about SN 1987A remain unanswered. How did the enigmatic three rings form in the late stages of Sanduleak -69 202? Precisely what took place in the center during the core collapse and bounce? Is a black hole or a neutron star left behind in the debris? SAINTS has been a continuous program since HST was launched-- we propose to extend this rich and deep data set for present use and future reference to answer these central questions in the science of supernovae.
