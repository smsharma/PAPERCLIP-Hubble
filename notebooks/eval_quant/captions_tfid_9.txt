Category: SOLAR SYSTEM.  We propose to carry out high-resolution imaging of the near-nuclearregions of comet Hyakutake to determine the structure and evolution of theplasma.	These images will determine the nature of the comet's interactionwith the solar wind, show the morphology of the comet's magnetic field,provide insight to mechanisms for disconnection events (DE's), and assist indetermining the important mechanism for ionizing molecules in comets.  Theinteraction of the solar wind with comets -- capture of solar magnetic fieldlines, formation of the plasma tail, formation of rays, activity includingdisconnection events, ionization of molecules -- is widely believed tofollow a standard paradigm. None of the features of the paradigm have beenverified for nuclear distances less than about 1000 km or with spatialresolutions comparable to the expected dimension of fine structure.  Thisdimension is the Larmor radius of water ions; for this case, about 15 km.For a comet with a geocentric distance of 1 AU, each WFC-2 chip willcover about 55,000 km on a side, with a resolution of 72 km.	Such animage would provide, by far, the most stringent test of our physical viewof the comet/solar wind interaction.  These observations require a cometof total visual magnitude 10 or less, the preferred target being a newcomet of magnitude 7 or less.

Category: INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM.  The nature of the cometary forms seen in the Helix Nebula, NGC 7293 are an unresolved puzzle.  The fact that this is the closest of the planetary nebulae indicates that we may be seeing a phenomenon  simply unresolved in the more distant planetaries. The interpretation of these forms ranges from the straightforward explanation of their being instabilities, to interpretations having far greater impact, such as being remnants of the extended envelope of the precursor star, to being components of an Oort Cloud of comets formed when the precursor star was created.  The emission line filter images that we propose for the WFPC2 would provide direct and quantitative information that will allow resolution of the nature of these objects.
